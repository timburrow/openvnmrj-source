Protocol: AhXYX  Sequence: ahXYX.c  Apptype: solidseq1d

Description: 

A 3D sequence to provide XYX correlation with HXYX triple cross 
polarization followed by DARR mixing. The F1 period follows HX CP,
The F2 period follows XY CP and a YX CP is followed by DARR mixing
and F3 acquisition.  

Decoupling during F1,F2 and F3 uses either 2-angle SPINAL or TPPM
and a constant time option is provided. Y refocusing during F1 is 
provided by a softpulse and X refocusing during F2 is provided by 
a composite pulse. 

A constant-time decoupling period, tRF, follows acquisition to
compensate d2 and d3 decoupling.
