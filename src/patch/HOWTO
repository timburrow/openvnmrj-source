To make a patch, make a git branch from the release.

To make a 100 series patch:
1. Update the SConstructpatch file to include any git directories
   that need to be compiled.
2. Update the SConstructpatch_100 file to update the patch name and to
   define specific files to be included in the patch.
3. Update patch/Readme to update the Readme file associated with the patch.

mv the two SConstruct files up one level, to git-repo/software and then execute them.
run "scons -f SConstructpatch" to recompile sources and
run "scons -f SConstructpatch_100" to build a new patch.

This part has not been updated. There is an example of making a 500 patch in the
