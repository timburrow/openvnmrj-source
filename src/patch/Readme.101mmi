This patch is for Agilent NMR Systems running VnmrJ 4.2A
It is for MercuryVx, MercuryPlus, and Inova systems.
It is not for VNMRS, 400MR, DD2, 400MR-DD2, or ProPulse systems.
There is a separate patch for those systems.
It can also be installed on "virtual machine" based datastation software.
It cannot be installed on the native MacOS version of VJ42.

Installation instructions:
--------------------------
 - The acquisition processes need be stopped to install this patch (su acqproc).
 - Any executing VnmrJ processes must be exited.
 - You must install this patch as the VnmrJ administrator (typically vnmr1).
 - To install the patch, use
        patchinstall 4.2_LNX_MMI_107.ptc
   (you may also use an absolute file path).
 - After the patch installation is complete, you will need to restart
   the acquisition processes (su acqproc). A "setacq" is not needed.
 - After the patch installation is complete, you will need to run vnmrj adm
   and update user accounts

Patch Description: 4.2_LNX_MMI_105
-----------------------

Also, early installers of the "104" patch found that the traymax parameter
was being set to 0. This is also fixed in this patch. See the patch
description for the "104" patch for other things addressed by this patch.

Recompiling some solidspack sequences could give confusing DPS displays.
Selecting a mapname for new proshim menu could assign mapnames to other menu items.
dssa and dss display bugs were fixed.

Accounting could cause acquisitions to fail.
