This patch is for Agilent NMR Systems running VnmrJ 4.2A
It is for VNMRS, 400MR, DD2, 400MR-DD2, and ProPulse systems.
It is not for Mercury or Inova systems. It is not for "virtual machine"
based datastation software nor for the native MacOS versions of VJ42.

Installation instructions:
--------------------------
 - The acquisition processes do not need be stopped to install this patch.
 - Any executing VnmrJ processes must be exited.
 - You must install this patch as the VnmrJ administrator (typically vnmr1).
 - To install the patch, use
        patchinstall 4.2_LNX_DDR_501.ptc
   (you may also use an absolute file path).
 - After the patch installation is complete, you will need to run setacq

This patch fixes a bug where aborting an acquisition cause cause other acquisition
errors to be reported. These other errors are "FIFO underflow", "FIFO overflow", or
"FIFO opcode" errors. THese errors can stop an automation run. This problem is often
seen during the "protune" step of an automation run, since the protune process
does multiple starts and aborts data acquisitions.
