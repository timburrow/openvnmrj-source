*******************************************************************************
fullarchive_ALSOLIDSPACK4 - SolidsPack macro used to create a zipped archive
            file for the entire SolidsPack contents. 
*******************************************************************************

The macro fullarchive_ALSOLIDSPACK4 archives each of the sequences of SolidsPack,
sequencename.c, from a user and zips each of them in ~/vnmrsys/ARCHIVE/EXP_OUTPUT
as sequencename.tar.Z and sequencename.README. The files of each sequence are also
saved in the directory ~/vnmrsys/ARCHIVE/sequencename. The files of all sequences 
are also placed in the directory ~/vnmrsys/ARCHIVE/SOLIDSPACKVJ4 and zipped in 
~/vnmrsys/ARCHIVE/EXP_OUTPUT as solidspackvj4.tar.Z and solidspackvj4.README.

This macro also archives general macros and manual files for SolidsPack. To 
add a sequence to the zipped contents, insert the line: 

narchive_SEQUENCE4('sequencename') fullarchive($name_upper,'sequencename').
