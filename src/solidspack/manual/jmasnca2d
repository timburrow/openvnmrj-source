Protocol: Jmasnca2d  Sequence: jmasnca2d.c  Apptype: solidseq1d

Description: 

     Constant, linear or tangent-ramped CP from H to X followed by 2D 
     X-Y correlation using a constant-time J-inept transfer between Y and
     X, with X acquisition using SPINAL or TPPM decoupling. 

Acknowledgement: 

     The initial code for this sequence was obtained from CCNY, Ruth Stark and 
     Hsin Wang. It was modified to be consistent with SolidsPack conventions. 

Setup: 

     Calibrate the individual shaped pulses with tancpxref.c. Also optimize 
     The C-H SPINAL decoupling for a maximum intensity of refocussing 
     with the desired refocussing times. Use these values for Hmixspinal. 

     Obtain a standard spectrum with Tancpx. Determine the offsets for CA,
     CO shaped pulses from this spectrum and enter the shaped pulse parameters
     for each pulse using the information above. The N pulse is usually set 
     as a square 180-degree inversion with hard-pulse calibrations of aY90 
     and pwY90.

     Enter values of taua and taub for J-defocussing and refocussing as multiples 
     of the rotor period. 

     Set sw1 to a minimum value to represent the C-alpha region and use
     64-128 increments, phase=1,2. The maximum F1 acquisition time must 
     be less than 2.0*(taua) minus the number of rotor periods spanned by the shcaX 
     shaped pulse. The shcoX pulse only appears if the F1 increment has a value
     of d2 greater than the number of rotor periods spanned by this pulse. 

     Run and process with wft2da.

              preparation pulse. Also used to store the dec calibration.
Parameters:  Channels Page
      aH90  - the amplitude of the pulse.
      pwH90 - the pulse length.

cpHY:  Module:  yes
Sequence:  dcptan.c
Description:  Implements constant, linear or tangent-ramped cross
              polarization from dec to dec2.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       shHY - 'c', constant, 'l', linear and 't', tangent shape on the
              channel designated with
                      chHY.
       chHY - the variable-amplitude channel, 'fr' from or 'to', to.
       aHhy - median amplitude of the dec channel.
       aXhy - median amplitude of the dec2 channel.
       bHY - tangent curvature (>0 to 1.0e5).
       dHY - +/- amplitude width of the ramp. A negative width sets a
              ramp that starts high and decreases in amplitude.
       tHY - contact time.
       ofHY - overall offset on the variable channel.
       frHY = 'dec' - channel with the initial polarization (must be
              set - not shown).   
       toHY = 'dec2' - channel with the final polarization (must be set
              - not shown).
Implementation: CP hy = getcp("HY",0.0,0.0,0,1);
Underscore function: _cp_(hy,phHhx,phYhy); phHhx is the overall phase
              table for the H channel and phYhy is that for the Y channel.

shY:  Module: yes (also shcaX and shcoX)
Sequence:  jmasnca2d.c
Description:  Implements a shaped refocussing pulse on Y for INEPT mixing. This
              can usually be declared "square" with the amplitude of aY90 and a 
              180 degree flip angle. 
               
              shcaX - implements a selective C-alpha inversion pulse on X for 
              INEPT transfer. It is typically used as "rsnob" with a width of 
              about 200 ns. The sampe pulse is used for refocusing. 

              shcoX - implements a selective carbonyl inversion pulse on X for 
              to refocus the NCO J coupling. It is typically used as "rsnob" 
              with a width of about 400 ns.

       wvXsh - pBox pulse waveshape from wavelib.
       aXsh - amplitude of pBox pulse.

Underscore function: _pboxpulse(sh,phXsh);
              _pboxsimpulse(sh,shp2,phXsh,phHshp2);
              _pboxsim3pulse(sh,shp2,shp3,phXsh,phHshp2,phYshp3);
Notes:  phXsh (and 2 or 3) is the overall phase table for the shape.
        _pboxsim(3)pulse uses multiple shapes where the arguments are 
        obs, dec, dec2 in order.  Label the shapes with the correct 
        channel identifier X, H, Y using getpboxpulse depending on the 
        channel for which it is used. _pboxsim(3)pulse cannot accept 
        shapes on dec (identifier Z). 

taua - an individual parameter that sets the J-defocussing time of the 
       NCA J coupling.  It is usually about 9.6 ms. 

taub - an individual parameter that sets the J refocussing of the NCA 
       J coupling. It is usually about 12 ms.
