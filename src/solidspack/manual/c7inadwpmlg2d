Parameter Groups

prep1X:  Module:  no
Sequence:  c7inadwpmlg2d.c
Description:  Implements a composite pulse consisting of a 90-degree
              flip followed by a smaller flip-angle to implement quadrature
              detection about a tilted precession axis.  Typically followed
              by a windowed multiple-pulse acquisition.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aXprep1 - the amplitude of the obs pulses.
       pw1Xprep1 - 90-degree flip on the obs channel.
       pw2Xprep1 - smaller flip on the obs channel.
       phXprep1 - small-angle phase offset of the pulse. The phase must
              be reset to zero after the pulse.

pmlgX:  Module:  yes
Sequence:  c7inad2dwpmlg.c
Description:  Implements "phase modulated Lee Goldburg", PMLG,
              homonuclear decoupling on the obs channel.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aXpmlg - amplitude of PMLG obs pulses.
       pwXpmlg - 360-degree flip on obs, off resonance (the length of
              each of the two PMLG pulses).
       nXpmlg - PMLG cycles represented in the .DEC file.
       qXpmlg - number of phase steps in that make up pwXpmlg. A
              negative value implements descending phases in the
              first pulse.
       chXpmlg = 'dec' must be set (not shown).
Implementation: MPSEQ pmlg = getpmlg("pmlgX",0,0.0,0.0,0,1);
Underscore functions: _MPSEQ functions.

scalef1X: (processing)  Module:  no
Sequence:  c7inadwpmlg2d.c
Description:  Shows the F1 scale factor, scalesw1, for evolution of the
              obs nuclei under a multiple-pulse waveform.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       scalesw1 - the F1 scale factor. Typically scalesw1 is the
              inverse of the mutiple-pulse scale factor.

c7X: Module:  yes
Sequence:  c7inad2d.c
Description:  Implements the Post C7 recoupling sequence on the obs
              channel.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aXc7 - amplitude of obs pulses.
       pwXc7 - 360-degree flip on obs.
       qXc7 - C7 cycles represented in the .DEC file.
       ofXc7 - overall frequency offset.
       chXc7 = 'obs' must be set (not shown).
Implementation: MPSEQ c7 = getpostc7("c7X",0,0.0,0.0,0,1);
Underscore functions: _MPSEQ functions.

wpmlgX:  Module:  yes
Sequence:  wpmlg1d.c
Description:  Implements windowed PMLG homonuclear decoupling with 
              acquisition in the window.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aXwpmlg - amplitude of PMLG on obs.
       pwXwpmlg - 360-degree flip on obs, off resonance (the length of
              each of the two PMLG pulses).
       qXwpmlg - number of phase steps that make up pwXpmlg. A negative
              value implements descending phases in the first pulse.
       r1Xwpmlg - prepulse delay (similar to rof1).
       r2Xwpmlg - postpulse delay (similar to rd or rof2).
       r3Xwpmlg - T/R-to-rcvron delay (must equal rof3 or 2.0 us if
              rof3 is not defined.
       tauXwpmlg - time for one PMLG cycle including the window.
       npaXwpmlg - number of 100 ns ticks in the detection window.
       chXwpmlg = 'obs' must be set (not shown).
Implementation:  WMPA wpmlg = getwpmlg("wpmlgX");
Underscore function: _wpmlg(wpmlg,phXwpmlg);  phXwpmlg is the overall
              phase table.

scaleX: (processing)  Module:  no
Sequence:  br24.c
Description:  Shows the F2 scale factor, scalesw, for evolution of the
              obs nuclei under a multiple-pulse waveform.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       scalesw - the F2 scale factor. Typically scalesw is the inverse
              of the mutiple-pulse scale factor.
