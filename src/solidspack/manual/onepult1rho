      aX90  - the amplitude of the pulse.
      pwX90 - the pulse length.

spinlockX:  Module:  no
Sequence:  tancpxt1rho.c.
Description:  Implements a CW spinlock on obs for T1u measurements with
              dec CW deoupling.

Hmixseq:  Module: yes
Sequence:  redor1tancp.c
Description:  Chooses SPINAL or TPPM decoupling on the dec channel
              during F1 and mixing periods when Hseq is used for
              acquisition.
Parameters:  Sequence Page - the Hmixspinal and Hmixtppm groups
              overlap.  Hmixseq chooses the decoupling sequence TPPM

Hmixspinal:  Module: yes
Sequence:  redor1tancp.c
Description:  Implements SPINAL decoupling on the dec channel during
