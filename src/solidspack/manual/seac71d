Protocol: Seac71d  Sequence: seac71d.c  Apptype: solidseq1d

Description:

        A sequence to provide X frequency selective longitudinal 
        homonuclear recoupling using shifted evolution enhanced 
        C7, SEAC7, with SPINAL and TPPM decoupling. 

Additional Software:

reset_seac7 - This macro uses the calibrated values of pwX90, aX90 and
        srate to set up the SEAC7 recoupling sequence.  The amplitude 
        aHmix is set to aH90. The macro is executed by the protocol.

Parameter Groups:

90H:  Module:  no
Sequence:  tancpx.c
Description:   Provides a 90-degree pulse on dec that can be used as a
               preparation pulse. Also used to store the dec calibration.
Parameters:  Channels Page
       aH90  - the amplitude of the pulse.
       pwH90 - the pulse length.

cpHX:  Module:  yes
Sequence:  tancpx.c
Description:  Implements constant, linear or tangent-ramped cross
              polarization from dec to obs.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       shHX - 'c', constant, 'l', linear and 't', tangent shape on the
              channel designated with chHX.
       chHX - the variable-amplitude channel, 'fr' from or 'to', to.
       aHhx - median amplitude of the dec channel.
       aXhx - median amplitude of the obs channel.
       bHX - +/- tangent curvature (>0 to 1.0e5).

              that starts high and decreases in amplitude.
       tHX - contact time
       ofHX - overall offset on the variable channel
       frHX = 'dec' -  channel with the initial polarization (must be
              set - not shown).

              - not shown).
