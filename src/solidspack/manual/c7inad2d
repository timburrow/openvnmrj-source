Protocol: C7inad2d  Sequence: c7inad2d.c  Apptype: solidseq1d

Description:

A sequence to correlate X-nucleus pairs with double quantum filtering.
F1 is the evolution of double-quantum coherence and F2 is single
quantum chemical shift. The spectral appearance is similar to the
INADEQUATE experiment. Polarization along the Z axis is created with a
constant, linear or tangent ramped CP followed by a flip-back pulse on
X. C7 is used to recouple double quantum coherence and a second pulse
returns polarization to X.  TPPM or SPINAL decoupling is applied
during acquisition and CW decoupling with an amplitude aHmix is applied
during C7.

Additional Software:

reset_c7 - This macro uses the calibrated values of pwX90, aX90 and 
srate to set up the C7 recoupling sequence.  The amplitude aHmix is set
to aH90. The macro is executed by the protocol.

Setup:

Load a calibrated data set and select the protocol C7inad2d. For a new 
nucleus calibrate CP with Onepul and Tancpx and then select C7inad2d.

Select the desired decoupling method, TPPM or SPINAL. The manual file
onepul describes calibration of decoupling.

Be sure the MAS Rate on the Acquisition page is set correctly.

The macro reset_c7 is run by the protocol and performs the next steps.

1. Set pwXc7 = 1.0e6/(7.0*srate) where srate is the current MAS Rate on
the Acquisition page.  The value of pwXc7 is rounded to a 100 ns grid.
2. Set aXc7 = aX90*4.0*pwX90/pwXc7.  
3. Set aHmix = aX90.  aHmix is the amplitude of CW decoupling during
the C7 pulses.

Array qXc7 to determine the value that provides the maximum signal

Set qXc7 to the desired value.  Set sw1 = 2.0*sw, ni = 64-256 and phase
= 1,2.

Collect the 2D data set and process with wft2da.  Coupled nuclei will
appear as pairs in F2 traces and will be shifted in F1 by twice the
median chemical shift.
