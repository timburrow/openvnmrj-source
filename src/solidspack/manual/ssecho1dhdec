90H:  Module:  no
Sequence:  tancpx.c
Description:  Provides a 90-degree pulse on H-channel that can be used
              as a preparation pulse. Also used to store the H-channel
              calibration.
Parameters:  Channels Page
       aH90  - the amplitude of the pulse.
       pwH90 - the pulse length.

echoH: Module: no
Sequence:  ssecho1dhdec.c
Description: Implements a refocusing pulse with delays before and after 
the pulse.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aHecho - amplitude of the H pulses. 
       t1Hecho - delay before the refocusing pulse. 
       pwHecho - 180-degree flip on H-channel. 
       t2Hecho - delay after the refocusing pulse. 


hdec1H:  Module:  yes
Sequence: hh2dhdec.c
Description: Chooses various decoupling methods: PMLG, FSLG, SAM, TPPM.
	     For each decoupling methods uses "get" functions from
             SolidsPack. 
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       dmHhdec1 - flag to switch on/off the optional decoupling. 
                  Possible values: 'y' and 'n'. 
       seqHhdec1 - decoupling method. Possible values - 'pmlg',
                   'fslg', 'sam', 'tppm'.
       aHhdec1 - amplitude of the decoupling.
       pwHhdec1 - pulse width for the decoupling.For FSLG and PMLG: 
                  360-degree flip, off resonance (the length of
                  each of the two FSLG/PMLG pulses).
                  For SAM: the time of one rotor period
                  For TPPM: approximate 180-degree flip angle on
                  resonance.
       qHhdec1 - integer multiplier. Relevant for PMLG and SAM. 
              For PMLG: the number of phase steps in that make 
              up pwHhdec1. A negative value implements descending
              phases in the first pulse.
	      For SAM: the number of RF cycles per rotor cycle.
       nHhdec1 - waveform cycles represented in the .DEC file.
       mHhdec1 - integer parameter. Not currently in use and 
                 should be set to 1.
       ofdHhdec1 - for FSLG: +/- frequency offset of alternating pulses, a
              negative value indicates that the first pulse has
              negative offset.
       ofHhdec1 - overall frequency offset for the chosen decoupling 
              technique.
       pwHshort1 - duration of the correction pulse for tilted axis 
              (FLSG/PMLG).
       chHhdec1 - 'obs' must be set (not shown).
