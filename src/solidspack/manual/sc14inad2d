Protocol: Sc14inad2d  Sequence: sc14inad2d.c  Apptype: solidseq1d

Description:
        1Q-2Q correlation using SC14 mixing, with TPPM or SPINAL
        decoupling.

Additional Software:

reset_sc14 - This macro uses the calibrated values of pwX90, aX90 and
srate to set up the SC14 recoupling sequence.  The amplitude aHmix is set
to aH90. The macro is executed by the protocol.

Setup:

Load a calibrated data set and select the protocol Sc14inad2d. For a new
nucleus calibrate CP with Onepul and Tancpx and then select Sc14inad2d.
   
Select the desired decoupling method, TPPM or SPINAL. The manual file
onepul describes calibration of decoupling.

Be sure the MAS Rate on the Acquisition page is set correctly.

The macro reset_sc14 is run by the protocol and performs the next steps.

1. Set pwXsc14 = 4.0e6/(14.0*srate) where srate is the current MAS Rate on
the Acquisition page.  The value of pwXsc14 is rounded to a 100 ns grid.
2. Set aXsc14 = aX90*4.0*pwX90/pwXc7.
3. Set aHmix = aX90.  aHmix is the amplitude of CW decoupling during
the C7 pulses.

Array qXsc14 to determine the value that provides the maximum signal

Set qXsc14 to the desired value.  Set sw1 = 2.0*sw, ni = 64-256 and phase
= 1,2.

Collect the 2D data set and process with wft2da.  Coupled nuclei will
appear as pairs in F2 traces and will be shifted in F1 by twice the
median chemical shift.

90H:  Module:  no
Sequence:  tancpx.c
Description:   Provides a 90-degree pulse on dec that can be used as a
               preparation pulse. Also used to store the dec calibration.
Parameters:  Channels Page
       aH90  - the amplitude of the pulse.
       pwH90 - the pulse length.

cpHX:  Module:  yes
Sequence:  tancpx.c
Description:  Implements constant, linear or tangent-ramped cross
              polarization from dec to obs.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       shHX - 'c', constant, 'l', linear and 't', tangent shape on the
              channel designated with chHX.
       chHX - the variable-amplitude channel, 'fr' from or 'to', to.
       aHhx - median amplitude of the dec channel.
       aXhx - median amplitude of the obs channel.
       bHX - +/- tangent curvature (>0 to 1.0e5).

       frHX = 'dec' -  channel with the initial polarization (must be
              set - not shown).
