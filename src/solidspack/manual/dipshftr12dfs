Protocol: Dipshftr12dfs  Sequence: dipshftr12dfs.c  Apptype: solidsseq1d

Description:

   A spin echo experiment on "X" with "H" to "X" r1235 recoupling on "H" to 
   measure the "H"-"X" dipolar interaction of quadrupole nuclei with DFS 
   enhancement of the "X" signal, with TPPM or SPINAL decoupling.  

Additional Software

reset_dipshftr12 : This macro resets r12 as in reset_r12, sets up 
    a heteronuclear 2D experimentand synchronizes the spin echo with the 
    rotor.
