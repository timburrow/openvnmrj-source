Protocol: Trapdor1d  Sequence: trapdor1d.c  Apptype: solidseq1d

Description:

Trapdor on X with H modulation followed by CP to X with SPINAL
or TPPM decoupling.

Note that this pulse sequence would must often be used with
high-band observe. Nevertheless it uses the standard channel
identifiers where X = obs and H = dec.

Parameter  Groups:

trapXH:  Module:  no
Sequence:  trapdor1d.c     
Description:  Implements a two-pulse TRAPDOR sequence with an echo on 
              obs and a tramsitter pulse on dec in the first tau period. 
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aXhxtrap - amplitude of the obs channel.
       aHxhtrap - amplitude of the dec channel.
       pw1Xxhtrap - first pulse on obs.
       t1XHtrap - first tau period - dec transmitter on.
       pw2Xxhtrap - second pulse on obs.
       t2XHtrap - second tau period.
 
Hseq:  Module:  yes
Sequence:  tancpx.c  
Description: Chooses SPINAL or TPPM decoupling on the dec channel
             during acquisition.
Parameters:  Sequence Page - the Hspinal and Htppm groups overlap.
       Hseq - chooses the decoupling sequence, TPPM or SPINAL.
Implementation:  DSEQ dec = getdseq("H");  The router implements
             getspinal() or gettppm().
Underscore functions: _dseqon(dec); runs _tppm(); or _spinal();_
             dseqoff(dec); runs decprgoff();

Hspinal:  Module:  yes
Sequence: tancpx.c
Description:  Implements SPINAL decoupling on the dec channel during
              acquisition. 
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aHspinal - amplitude of the dec channel.
       pwHspinal - approximate 180-degree flip angle on resonance.
       phHspinal - +/- small angle phase. SPINAL64 is implemented
              with phases = +/- 1.0, +/- 1.5 and +/-2.0 times
              phHspinal.
       chHspinal = 'dec' must be set (not shown).
Implementation: SPINAL dec = getspinal("H"); or DSEQ dec =
              getdseq("H");
Underscore functions: _spinal(dec); and decprgoff(); or
             _dseqon(dec); and _dseqoff(dec);

Htppm:  Module:  yes
Sequence:  tancpx.c
Description:  Implements TPPM decoupling on the dec channel during
              acquisition.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aHtppm - amplitude of the dec channel.
       pwHtppm - approximate 180-degree flip angle on resonance.
       phHtppm - +/- small angle phase. TPPM is implemented
              with phases = +/- 1.0 times phHtppm for alternating
              pulses.
       chHtppm = 'dec' must be set (not shown).
Implementation: TPPM dec = gettppm("H"); or DSEQ dec = getdseq("H"); 
Underscore functions: _tppmon(dec); and decprgoff(); or _dseqon(dec);
              and _dseqoff(dec);
