Protocol: Onepulref  Sequence: onepulref.c  Apptype: solidseq1d

Description: X direct polarization followed by a soft inversion 
             spin echo, using SPINAL or TPPM decoupling. 

Parameter Groups: 

90X:  Module:  no
Sequence:  onepul.c
Description:  Provides a 90-degree pulse on obs that can be used as a
              preparation pulse. Also used to store the obs calibration.
Parameters:  Channels Page
      aX90  - the amplitude of the pulse.
      pwX90 - the pulse length.
 
Hmixseq:  Module: yes 
Sequence:  redor1tancp.c
Description:  Chooses SPINAL or TPPM decoupling on the dec channel
              during F1 and mixing periods when Hseq is used for
              acquisition.
Parameters:  Sequence Page - the Hmixspinal and Hmixtppm groups
              overlap.  Hmixseq chooses the decoupling sequence TPPM
              or SPINAL.
Implementation:  DSEQ mix = getdseq("H"); The router implements
              getspinal() or gettppm(), as selected.
Underscore functions:  _dseqon(mix); runs _tppm(); or _spinal();
             _dseqoff(mix); runs decprgoff(mix);

Hmixspinal:  Module: yes
Sequence:  redor1tancp.c
Description:  Implements SPINAL decoupling on the dec channel during
              typical F1 and mixing periods when Hspinal is used for
              acquisition.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aHmixspinal - amplitude of the dec channel.
       pwHmixspinal - approximate 180-degree flip.
       phHmixspinal - +/- small angle phase. SPINAL64 is implemented
              with phases = +/- 1.0, +/- 1.5 and +/-2.0 times
              phHmixspinal.
       chHmixspinal = 'dec' must be set (not shown).
Implementation: SPINAL mix = getspinal("H"); or DSEQ mix =
             getdseq("H");
Underscore functions: _spinal(mix); and decprgoff(); or _dseqon(mix);
             and _dseqoff(mix);
        
Hmixtppm:  Module: yes
Sequence:  redor1tancp.c
Description:  Implements TPPM decoupling on the dec channel during
              typical F1 and mixing periods when Htppm is used for
              acquisition.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aHmixtppm - amplitude of the dec channel.
       pwHmixtppm - approximate 180-degree flip angle on resonance.
       phHmixtppm - +/- small angle phase. TPPM is implemented
              with phases = +/- 1.0 times phHmixtppm for alternating
              pulses.
       chHmixtppm = 'dec' must be set (not shown).
Implementation: TPPM mix = gettppm("H"); or DSEQ mix = getdseq("H");
Underscore functions: _tppm(mix); and decprgoff(); or _dseqon(mix); and
              _dseqoff(mix);

shp1X:  Module:  yes
Sequence:  pboxonepul.c
Description:  Implements a soft pulse with pBox with selection of any
              channel.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       chXshp1 = 'obs','dec','dec2','dec3' selected in panel.
       wvXshp1 = pBox pulse waveshape from wavelib.
       aXshp1 - amplitude of pBox pulse.
       dbXshp1 - attenuator setting for pBox pulse.
       tXshp1 - predelay for pBox pulse.
       pwXshp1 - width of pBox pulse.
       phXshp1 - starting small angle phase adjust.
       stXshp1 - shape parameter Â– see pBox documentation
Implementation:  PBOXPULSE shp1 = getpboxpulse("shp1X",0);
              PBOXPULSE shp2 = getpboxpulse("shp2X",0);
              PBOXPULSE shp3 = getpboxpulse("shp3X",0);
Underscore function: _pboxpulse(shp1,phXshp1);
              _pboxsimpulse(shp1,shp2,phXshp1,phXshp2);
              _pboxsim3pulse(shp1,shp2,shp3,phXshp1,phXshp2,phXshp3);
Notes:  No two shapes can be defined on the same channel.  phXshp1
             (and 2 or 3) is the overall  phase table for the shape.
             _pboxsimpulse and _pboxsim3pulse cannot accept shapes on
             dec3.
