Protocol: Twopul  Sequence: twopul.c  Apptype: solidseq1d

Description: 

A two-pulse X experiment with a delay d2 and with a choice of SPINAL64 
or TPPM decoupling. Used for inversion recovery T1 measurements.  

Setup: 

Load a calibrated data set and select the protocol Twopul. For a new 
nucleus set the desired observe nucleus and use Onepul to obtain a 
calibration of pwX90. Select Twopul and set pwX180 = 2.0*pwX90. 

Select the desired decoupling method, TPPM or SPINAL. The manual file 
onepul describes calibration of decoupling. 

Array d2 with a log array to measure spin lattice relation. Use the 
macro T1 to analyze the data. 
 
Parameter Groups: 

90X:  Module:  no
Sequence:  onepul.c    
Description:  Provides a 90-degree pulse on obs that can be used as a 
              preparation pulse. Also used to store the obs calibration.
Parameters:  Channels Page
      aX90  - the amplitude of the pulse.
      pwX90 - the pulse length.

180X:   Module:  no
Sequence:  twopul.c    
Description:  Provides a 180-degree pulse on obs that can be used as an 
              inversion or a refocusing pulse.  
Parameters:  Sequence Page
      aX180 -  the amplitude of the pulse.
      pwX180 - the pulse length. 

Hseq:  Module:  yes 
Sequence:  tancpx.c      
Description:  Chooses SPINAL or TPPM decoupling on the dec channel 
              during acquisition.
Parameters:  Sequence Page - the Hspinal and Htppm groups overlap. 
       Hseq - chooses the decoupling sequence, TPPM or SPINAL. 
Implementation:  DSEQ dec = getdseq("H");  The router implements 
              getspinal() or gettppm(). 
Underscore functions: _dseqon(dec); runs _tppm(); or _spinal();
              _dseqoff(dec); runs decprgoff();  

Hspinal:  Module:  yes 
Sequence: tancpx.c  
Description:  Implements SPINAL decoupling on the dec channel during 
              acquisition.  
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aHspinal - amplitude of the dec channel. 
       pwHspinal - approximate 180-degree flip angle on resonance. 
       phHspinal - +/- small angle phase. SPINAL64 is implemented with 
              phases = +/- 1.0, +/- 1.5 and +/-2.0 times phHspinal. 
       chHspinal = 'dec' must be set (not shown).
Implementation: SPINAL dec = getspinal("H"); or DSEQ dec = 
              getdseq("H");  
Underscore functions: _spinal(dec); and decprgoff(); or _dseqon(dec); 
              and _dseqoff(dec);   

Htppm:  Module:  yes 
Sequence:  tancpx.c      
Description:  Implements TPPM decoupling on the dec channel during 
              acquisition.  
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aHtppm - amplitude of the dec channel.
       pwHtppm - approximate 180-degree flip angle on resonance.
       phHtppm - +/- small angle phase. TPPM is implemented
              with phases = +/- 1.0 times phHtppm for alternating pulses.
       chHtppm = 'dec' must be set (not shown).
Implementation: TPPM dec = gettppm("H"); or DSEQ dec = getdseq("H"); 
Underscore functions: _tppmon(dec); and decprgoff(); or _dseqon(dec);
              and _dseqoff(dec);
