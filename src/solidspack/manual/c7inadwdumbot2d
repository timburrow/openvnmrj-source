Additional Softtware

reset_c7inadwdumbot2d - This macro uses the calibrated values of pwX90, aX90 and 
srate to set up the C7 recoupling mixing sequence, DUMBO for F1 and Windowed 
DUMBO with tilt pulses for F2. The macro is executed by the protocol.

Parameter Groups

prepX:  Module:  no
Sequence:  br24q.c
Description:  Implements a variable length pulse to provide quadrature
              detection about a tilted precession axis. Typically
              followed by a windowed multiple-pulse acquisition.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aXprep - the amplitude of the obs pulses.
       pwXprep - 90-degree flip on the obs channel.
       phXprep - small-angle phase offset of the pulse. The phase must
              be reset to zero after the pulse.

dumboX: Module:  yes
Sequence:  tancpxdumbo.c
Description: Implements DUMBO homonuclear decoupling on the obs
channel.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aXdumbo - amplitude of the DUMBO on obs.
       pwXdumbo - 1080-degree flip on obs (the length of full a DUMBO
              cycle).
       nXdumbo - DUMBO cycles represented in the .DEC file.
       ofXdumbo - overall frequency offset.
       chXdumbo = 'dec' must be set (not shown).
Implementation: MPSEQ dumbo = getdumbo("dumboX",0,0.0,0.0,0,1);
Underscore functions: _MPSEQ functions.

scalef1X: (processing)  Module:  no
Sequence:  c7inadwpmlg2d.c
Description:  Shows the F1 scale factor, scalesw1, for evolution of the
              obs nuclei under a multiple-pulse waveform.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       scalesw1 - the F1 scale factor. Typically scalesw1 is the
              inverse of the mutiple-pulse scale factor.

c7X: Module:  yes
Sequence:  c7inad2d.c
Description:  Implements the Post C7 recoupling sequence on the obs
              channel.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aXc7 - amplitude of obs pulses.
       pwXc7 - 360-degree flip on obs.
       qXc7 - C7 cycles represented in the .DEC file.
       ofXc7 - overall frequency offset.
       chXc7 = 'obs' must be set (not shown).
Implementation: MPSEQ c7 = getpostc7("c7X",0,0.0,0.0,0,1);
Underscore functions: _MPSEQ functions.	      

wdumbotX:  Module:  yes
Sequence:   wdumbot1d.c
Description:  Implements windowed DUMBO homonuclear decoupling on obs
              with acquisition in the window.  Tilt pulses around the
              acquisition window allow non-quadrature detection.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aXwdumbot - amplitude of DUMBO on obs.
       pw1Xwdumbot - 1080-degree flip on obs (the length of a full
              DUMBO cycle).
       pw2Xwdumbot - nominal 54.7-degree flip on obs for tilt pulses.
       r1Xwdumbot - prepulse delay (similar to rof1).
       r2Xwdumbot - postpulse delay (similar to rd or rof2).
       r3Xwdumbot - T/R-to-rcvron delay (must equal rof3 or 2.0 us if
              rof3 is not defined).
       tauXwdumbot - time for one DUMBO cycle including the window.
       npaXwdumbot - number of 100 ns ticks in the detection window.
       phXwdumbot - overall small-angle phase for DUMBO to align the
              tilted precession axis in the XY plane.
       chXwdumbot = 'obs' must be set (not shown).
Implementation:  WMPA wdumbot = getwdumbot("wdumbotX");
Underscore function: _wdumbot(wdumbot,phXwdumbot);  phXwdumbot is the
              overall phase table.

scaleX: (processing)  Module:  no
Sequence:  br24.c
Description:  Shows the F2 scale factor, scalesw, for evolution of the
              obs nuclei under a multiple-pulse waveform.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       scalesw - the F2 scale factor. Typically scalesw is the inverse
              of the mutiple-pulse scale factor.
