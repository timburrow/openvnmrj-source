Protocol: R2inv1d  Sequence: r2inv1d.c  Apptype: solidseq1d

Description: 

    A selective inversion on "X" using a hard 90 and a soft 180 after 
    a ramped CP preparation, a rotor-synchronized mixing period
    and an "X" detection pulse, with TPPM or SPINAL decoupling,  
    separate TPPM or SPINAL decoupling levels during mixing and 
    acquisition. 

Parameter  Groups: 

90H:  Module:  no
Sequence:  tancpx.c  
Description:  Provides a 90-degree pulse on dec that can be used 
              as a preparation pulse. Also used to store the dec 
              calibration.
Parameters:  Channels Page
       aH90  - the amplitude of the pulse.
       pwH90 - the pulse length.

cpHX:  Module:  yes
Sequence:  tancpx.c
Description:  Implements constant, linear or tangent-ramped cross 
              polarization from dec to obs. 
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       shHX - 'c', constant, 'l', linear and 't', tangent shape on
               the channel designated with chHX. 
       chHX - the variable-amplitude channel, 'fr' from or 'to', to. 
       aHhx - median amplitude of the dec channel.
       aXhx - median amplitude of the obs channel.
       bHX -  +/- tangent curvature (>0 to 1.0e5).  
       dHX -  amplitude width of the ramp. A negative width sets a
              ramp that starts high and decreases in amplitude.
       tHX -  contact time
       ofHX - overall offset on the variable channel
       frHX = 'dec' -  channel with the initial polarization (must 
              be set - not shown).           
       toHX = 'obs' -  channel with the final polarization (must be
              set - not shown). 
Implementation:  CP hx = getcp("HX",0.0,0.0,0,1); 
Underscore functions: _cp_(hx,phHhx,phXhx); 
 
r2invX:  Module:  no
Sequence:  r2inv1d.c
Description:  Implements a selective inversion pulse on obs between two
              90-degree pulses with a mixing period after the second
              pulse to provide a 1D rotational resonance measurement.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aXr2inv - amplitude of the hard obs pulses.
       asXr2inv - amplitude of the selective pulse.
       dbXr2inv - attenautor setting for the selective pulse.
       pwXr2inv - 90-degree flip of the obs hard pulse.
       pwsXr2inv - 180-degree flip of the obs selective pulse.
       tXr2inv - delay period for spin diffusion.
       ofsXr2inv - offset of the selective pulse.

Hseq:  Module:  yes 
Sequence:  tancpx.c      
Description: Chooses SPINAL or TPPM decoupling on the dec channel 
             during acquisition.
Parameters:  Sequence Page - the Hspinal and Htppm groups overlap.
       Hseq - chooses the decoupling sequence, TPPM or SPINAL. 
Implementation:  DSEQ dec = getdseq("H");  The router implements 
             getspinal() or gettppm(). 
Underscore functions: _dseqon(dec); runs _tppm(); or _spinal();_

       aHspinal - amplitude of the dec channel. 
       pwHspinal - approximate 180-degree flip angle on resonance. 
       phHspinal - +/- small angle phase. SPINAL64 is implemented 
              with phases = +/- 1.0, +/- 1.5 and +/-2.0 times 
              phHspinal. 
       chHspinal = 'dec' must be set (not shown).
Implementation: SPINAL dec = getspinal("H"); or DSEQ dec = 
              getdseq("H");
