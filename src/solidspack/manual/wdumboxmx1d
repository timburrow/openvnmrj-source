Protocol: Wdumboxmx1d  Sequence: wdumboxmx1d.c  Apptype: solidseq1d

Description: 

   A 1D acquisition on "X" with windowed DUMBO using a Z-rotation 
   supercycle.

Additional Software 

   reset_wdumboxmx1d - Sets aXwdumbo and pwXwdumbo to create a 6-pi 
   DUMBO pulse. Set the window tauXwdumbo to be at least 4 us with 
   a 1 us of receiver on. Reset scalesw to 1/sqrt(3) the nominal scale 
   factor.  Set the prep pulses from aX90 and pwX90. Set r1=1.0, r2=.5
   and r3 = 1.0 for wdumboX. 

Parameter Groups

prepX:  Module:  no
Sequence:  br24q.c
Description:  Implements a variable length pulse to provide quadrature
              detection about a tilted precession axis. Typically
              followed by a windowed multiple-pulse acquisition.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aXprep - the amplitude of the obs pulses.
       pwXprep - 90-degree flip on the obs channel.
       phXprep - small-angle phase offset of the pulse. The phase must
              be reset to zero after the pulse.

scaleX: (processing)  Module:  no
Sequence:  br24.c
Description:  Shows the F2 scale factor, scalesw, for evolution of the
              obs nuclei under a multiple-pulse waveform.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       scalesw - the F2 scale factor. Typically scalesw is the inverse
              of the mutiple-pulse scale factor.

wdumboX:  Module:  yes
Sequence:  wdumbo1d.c
Description:  Implements windowed DUMBO homonuclear decoupling with
              acquisition in the window.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aXwdumbo - amplitude of DUMBO on obs.
       pwXwdumbo - 1080-degree flip on obs (the length of full a DUMBO
              cycle).
       r1Xwdumbo - prepulse delay (similar to rof1).
       r2Xwdumbo - postpulse delay (similar to rd or rof2).
       r3Xwdumbo - T/R-to-rcvron delay (must equal rof3 or 2.0 us if
              rof3 is not defined.
       tauXwdumbo - time for one DUMBO cycle including the window.
       npaXwdumbo - number of 100 ns ticks in the detection window.
       phXwdumbo - overall small-angle phase for DUMBO to align  the
              tilted precession axis in the XY plane.
       chXwdumbo = 'obs' must be set (not shown).bo
Implementation:  WMPA wdumbo = getwdumbo("wdumboX");
Implementation:  WMPA wdumbo = getwdumboxmx("wdumboX");
Underscore function: _wdumbo(wdumbo,phXwdumbo); phXwdumbo is the
              overall phase table.
