Protocol: Wsam1d  Sequence: wsam1d.c  Apptype: solidseq1d

Description: 

Windowed SAMn acquisition on X.  

Additional Software

reset_wsam1d - This macro uses the calibrated values of pwH90 and aH90 
to calculate the intial parameters for the wsamX waveform and sets up 
2D parameters. 
Parameter Groups: 

prep1X:  Module:  no 
Sequence:  c7inadwpmlg2d.c       
Description:  Implements a composite pulse consisting of a 90-degree 
              flip followed by a smaller flip-angle to implement quadrature 
              detection about a tilted precession axis.  Typically followed
              by a windowed multiple-pulse acquisition.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aXprep1 - the amplitude of the obs pulses. 
       pw1Xprep1 - 90-degree flip on the obs channel. 
       pw2Xprep1 - smaller flip on the obs channel.
       phXprep1 - small-angle phase offset of the pulse. The phase must 
              be reset to zero after the pulse.

scaleX: (processing)  Module:  no 
Sequence:  br24.c    
Description:  Shows the F2 scale factor, scalesw, for evolution of the 
              obs nuclei under a multiple-pulse waveform. 
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       scalesw - the F2 scale factor. Typically scalesw is the inverse 
              of the mutiple-pulse scale factor.       

wsamX:  Module:  yes
Sequence:  wsam1d.c  
Description:  Implements windowed PMLG homonuclear decoupling with 
              acquisition in the window.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aXwsam - amplitude of PMLG on obs.
       pwXwsam - 360-degree flip on obs, off resonance (the length of 
              each of the two PMLG pulses).  
       qXwsam - number of phase steps that make up pwXpmlg. A negative 
              value implements descending phases in the first pulse.
       r1Xwsam - pre-pulse delay (similar to rof1). 
       r2Xwsam - post_pulse delay (similar to rd or rof2).
       r3Xwsam - T/R-to-rcvron delay (must equal rof3 or 2.0 us if 
              rof3 is not defined. 
       tauXwsam - time for one PMLG cycle including the window.
       npaXwsam - number of 100 ns ticks in the detection window.
       chXwsam = 'obs' must be set (not shown).
Implementation:  WMPA wsam = getwsamn("wpmlgX");
Underscore function: _wsamn(wsam,phXwsam);  phXwsam is the overall 
              phase table.
