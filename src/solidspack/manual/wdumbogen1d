Protocol: Wdumbogen1d  Sequence: wdumbogen1d.c  Apptype: solidseq1d

Description: 

   A 1D acquisition on "X" with windowed DUMBO calculated from coeffecients
   using a Z-rotation supercycle. 

Additional Software 

   reset_wdumbogen1d - Sets aXwdumbo and pwXwdumbo to create a 6-pi 
   DUMBO pulse. Set the window tauXwdumbo to be at least 4 us with 
   a 1 us of receiver on. Reset scalesw to 1/sqrt(3) the nominal scale 
   factor.  Set the prep pulses from aX90 and pwX90. Set r1=1.0, r2=.5
   and r3 = 1.0 for wdumboX. 

   reset_dcf - Sets 12 coefficients for standard DUMBO. 
   reset_edcf - Sets 6 coefficients for eDUMBO. 

   Uses Simplexer for adjustment of DUMBO coefficients. 

Parameter Groups

prep1X:  Module:  no
Sequence:  c7inadwpmlg2d.c
Description:  Implements a composite pulse consisting of a 90-degree
              flip followed by a smaller flip-angle to implement
              quadrature detection about a tilted precession axis.
              Typically followed by a windowed multiple-pulse
              acquisition.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aXprep1 - the amplitude of the obs pulses.
       pw1Xprep1 - 90-degree flip on the obs channel.
       pw2Xprep1 - smaller flip on the obs channel.
       phXprep1 - small-angle phase offset of the pulse. The phase must
              be reset to zero after the pulse.

scaleX: (processing)  Module:  no
Sequence:  br24.c
Description:  Shows the F2 scale factor, scalesw, for evolution of the
              obs nuclei under a multiple-pulse waveform.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       scalesw - the F2 scale factor. Typically scalesw is the inverse
              of the mutiple-pulse scale factor.

wdumboX:  Module:  yes
Sequence:  wdumbo1d.c
Description:  Implements windowed DUMBO homonuclear decoupling with
              acquisition in the window.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aXwdumbo - amplitude of DUMBO on obs.
       pwXwdumbo - 1080-degree flip on obs (the length of full a DUMBO
              cycle).
       r1Xwdumbo - prepulse delay (similar to rof1).
       r2Xwdumbo - postpulse delay (similar to rd or rof2).
       r3Xwdumbo - T/R-to-rcvron delay (must equal rof3 or 2.0 us if
              rof3 is not defined.
       tauXwdumbo - time for one DUMBO cycle including the window.
       npaXwdumbo - number of 100 ns ticks in the detection window.
       phXwdumbo - overall small-angle phase for DUMBO to align  the
              tilted precession axis in the XY plane.
       chXwdumbo = 'obs' must be set (not shown).bo
Implementation:  WMPA wdumbo = getwdumbo("wdumboX");
Implementation:  WMPA wdumbo = getwdumboxmx("wdumboX");
Underscore function: _wdumbo(wdumbo,phXwdumbo); phXwdumbo is the
              overall phase table.

dcfX:  Module: yes (called by getwdumbogen()) 
Sequence:   wdumbogen1d.c
Description:  A set of 12 coefficents - used to calculate DUMBO phases.
              Includes the parameter "sc" to turn on Z-rotation and "q" 
              to set the number of phases. Check boxes call reset_edcf
              (eDUMBO and reset_dcf (standard DUMBO) to set starting 
              coeeficients. 
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       ca#Xdcf - # = 1 to 6. 
       cb#Xdcf - # = 1 to 6. 
       scXdcf - supercycle "1" turns on Z-rotation and "0" turns it off. 
       qXdcf - the number of phases in the 3-pi DUMBO cycle. 
Implementation: WMPA wdumbo = getwdumbogen("wdumboX") only;
Underscore function: _wdumbo(wdumbo,phXwdumbo); phXwdumbo is the
              overall phase table.
