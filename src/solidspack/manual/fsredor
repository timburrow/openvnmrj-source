Parameter Groups

90H:  Module:  no
Sequence:  tancpx.c
Description:  Provides a 90-degree pulse on dec that can be used
              as a preparation pulse. Also used to store the dec
              calibration.
Parameters:  Channels Page
       aH90  - the amplitude of the pulse.
       pwH90 - the pulse length.

cpHX:  Module:  yes
Sequence:  tancpx.c
Description:  Implements constant, linear or tangent-ramped cross
              polarization from dec to obs.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       shHX - 'c', constant, 'l', linear and 't', tangent shape on
               the channel designated with chHX.
       chHX - the variable-amplitude channel, 'fr' from or 'to', to.
       aHhx - median amplitude of the dec channel.
       aXhx - median amplitude of the obs channel.
       bHX -  +/- tangent curvature (>0 to 1.0e5).
       dHX -  amplitude width of the ramp. A negative width sets a
              ramp that starts high and decreases in amplitude.
       tHX -  contact time
       ofHX - overall offset on the variable channel
       frHX = 'dec' -  channel with the initial polarization (must
              be set - not shown).
       toHX = 'obs' -  channel with the final polarization (must be
              set - not shown).
Implementation:  CP hx = getcp("HX",0.0,0.0,0,1);

              pulses per rotor period with the XY8 phase cycle and
              simultaneous selective Gaussian pulses on obs and dec2.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
