Protocol: Hetcordumbolgcp2d_1  Sequence: hetcordumbolgcp2d_1.c  Apptype: solidseq1d

Description:

    H to X HETCOR using DUMBO during F1 followed by a Lee-Goldburg CP and
    acquisition on X with TPPM or SPINAL decoupling.

    Apply a frequency offset to pwH90(1), samnH and pwH90(2) to offset F1
    DUMBO without disturbing CP or decoupling on resonance. tHmix is optional
    spin-diffusion mixing period.

    Z-rotation DUMBO provides F1 precession about Zed.  pwH90(3) and a tiltH
    pulse with amplitude aH90 allow an offset, Lee-Goldburg CP.

Additional Software:

reset_hetcordumbolgcp2d_1 - This macro uses the calibrated values of pwH90 
and aH90 to calculate the intial parameters for the dumboH waveform.  This 
macro is run from the protocol.

Setup:

Load a calibrated data set and select the protocol Hetcordumbolgcp2d_1. For a
new nucleus calibrate CP with Onepul and Tancpx and then set up Lee
Goldburg CP with Lgcp. Then select the protocol Hetcordumbolgcp2d_1.

Select the desired decoupling method, TPPM or SPINAL. The manual file
onepul describes calibration of decoupling.

Lee-Goldburg CP and decoupling should use an optimum dof value, calibrated
for CP. 

The macro reset_hetcordumbolgcp2d_1 is run from the Hetcordumbolgcp2d_1 
protocol.  This macro performs the next 4 steps.

1. Set aHdumbo = aH90.  Set pwHtilt = pwH90*35.3/90.0.  aH90 automatically
determines the tilt-pulse amplitude.
2. Set pwHdumbo = 12.0*.0*pwH90.  pwHdumbo is rounded to a 100 ns grid.
4. Set sw1 = 1.0/(pwHdumbo*1e-6). Set ni = 64 and phase = 1,2.
5. Set nHdumbo = 1 if nHdumbo < 1. nHdumbo is the number of DUMBO cycles in
the F1 period and it will be reset by the sequence for each F1 increment. 
Set pwX180 = 0.0 to *not* place an X refocusing pulse in the middle of the
F1 delay.  Most HETCOR's are run without a refocussing pulse.  A
refocusing pulse is only desirable if the X-H J-coupling is limiting
proton resolution.  MAS is adequate to remove the X-H dipolar
interaction.   If a refocusing pulse is desired then the spin rate must
be synchronized with the F1 dwell so that the refocusing pulse falls at
a multiple of the rotor period

For pwH90 (More page) and dumboH, set the parameter with  the "of"
prefix to 0.0. Z-rotation sequences should place the F1 offset in the 
middle of the spectrum (presumably at tof). The offset can be shifted
from tof as needed by setting this value. Note that the value of "of" 
is applied to the first two 90 degree pulses and the DUMBO.

Collect a 2D dataset and process with wft2da.  Adjust ni to accommodate
greater or lesser proton resolution of the sample in F1.

HETCOR is very sensitive to phase transient on the proton channel
(though Z-rotation DUMBO may be less sensitive than FSLG. Side effects
of a large transient are a short T2 and an offset of the spectrum in F1. 
It is recommended in general that one spend significant effort to remove
phase transient for HETCOR, but this sequence may be more tolerable. 
The procedure for phase-transient removal is in the manual file tunerp.

A good sample for a HETCOR setup is natural abundance glycine. A quick
HETCOR can be ni = 64, nt = 4, d1 = 1 and ss = 4.  Hetcordumbolgcp2d_1 works
with spin rate above 10 kHz. Note that one must avoid the condition where 
1.0/srate = N*pwHdumbo where N = 1,2 and 4. When DUMBO is calibrated with 
pwH90 = 2.5 us then srate = 1.0/4.0*pwHdumbo = 8333 Hz. Choose srate > 
10 kHz.  Also avoid synchronization at 16.7 kHz and 33.3 kZ as well. 

It is reasonable calibrate the pwH90 = 2.5 us to do "100 kHz" DUMBO 
during F1 if the probe has the appropriate specification. The best
field strength is a function of both decoupling linewidth and scale.
With a good result one will see a substantial splitting in the two
upfield methylene lines - from 20% to the baseline depending upon the
probe and calibration. In a Solenoid probe HETCOR can be improved by
constricting sample to 50% ofthe coil width.

The indirect axis of HETCOR is scaled by the value scalesw1. It will be 
necessary to adjust scalesw1 to obtain the correct ppm scale.
A rough calibration with glycine is obtained by putting two cursors on 
the two methylene lines of glycine. On the command line type scalesw1 =
dfrq/delta.  In general, set two lines with a known ppm difference Dppm
and set scalesw1 = Dppm*dfrq/delta where Dppm is the shift difference.

To reference F1 of a scaled HETCOR spectrum put a cursor on the peak
with a known ppm value and type rl1(ppm*dfrq/scalesw1). Note that
HETCOR spectra are displayed with axis ='pd' and refsource = 'dfrq'.
