Protocol: Phasetest  Sequence: phasetest.c  Apptype: solidseq1d

Description: 

Apply two back-back SHAPES on the X channel to determine phase 
amplitude and offset transition times. 


Parameter Groups:

901X:  Module:  yes
Sequence:  phasetest.c
Description:  Implements a pulse on the obs channel with offset.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aX901  - amplitude of the obs pulse.
       pwX901 - duration of the obs pulse.
       chX901 = 'obs' must be set (not shown).
       ofX901 - offset of the obs pulse
Implementation:  SHAPE p1 = getpulse("901X",0.0,0.0,0,1);
Underscore function: _shape(p1,phX901);  phX901 is the overall phase
              table.

902X:  Module:  yes
Sequence:  phasetest.c
Description:  Implements a pulse on the obs channel with offset.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aX902  - amplitude of the obs pulse.
       pwX902 - duration of the obs pulse.
       chX902 = 'obs' must be set (not shown).
       ofX902 - offset of the obs pulse
Implementation:  SHAPE p1 = getpulse("902X",0.0,0.0,0,1);
Underscore function: _shape(p1,phX902);  phX902 is the overall phase
              table.
