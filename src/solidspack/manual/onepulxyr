Protocol: Onepulxyr  Sequence: onepul.c  Apptype: solidseq1d

Description:

Single-pulse preparation of X and Y with observe on two channels, with
      a choice of SPINAL64 or TPPM decoupling.

Requires a second receiver on channel 3. RECXY - X = obs, Y = dec,
H = dec2, with observe on obs and dec.  obs must use channels 1 or 2
and dec must use channel 3.

Parameter Groups:

90X:  Module:  no
Sequence:  onepul.c
Description:  Provides a 90-degree pulse on obs that can be used
              as a preparation pulse. Also used to store the obs
              calibration.
Parameters:  Channels Page
      aX90  - the amplitude of the pulse.
      pwX90 - the pulse length.

90Y:  Module:  no
Sequence:  none
Description:  Provides a 90-degree pulse on dec that can be used as
              a preparation pulse. Also used to store the dec2
	      calibration.
Parameters:  Channels Page
       aY90  - the amplitude of the pulse.
       pY90 - the pulse length.
     
Hseq:  Module:  yes
Sequence:  tancpx.c
Description:  Chooses SPINAL or TPPM decoupling on the dec channel
              during acquisition.
Parameters:  Sequence Page - Hspinal and Htppm groups overlap.
       Hseq - chooses the decoupling sequence, TPPM or SPINAL.
Implementation:  DSEQ dec = getdseq("H");  The router implements
              getspinal() or gettppm().
Underscore functions: _dseqon(dec); runs _tppm(); or _spinal();
              _dseqoff(dec); runs decprgoff();

Hspinal:  Module:  yes
Sequence:  tancpx.c
Description:  Implements SPINAL decoupling on the dec channel during
              acquisition.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aHspinal - amplitude of the dec channel.
       pwHspinal - approximate 180-degree flip angle on resonance.
       phHspinal - +/- small angle phase. SPINAL64 is implemented
              with phases = +/- 1.0, +/- 1.5 and +/-2.0 times phHspinal.
       chHspinal = 'dec' must be set (not shown).
Implementation: SPINAL dec = getspinal("H"); or DSEQ dec =
              getdseq("H");
Underscore functions: _spinal(dec); and decprgoff(); or _dseqon(dec);
              and _dseqoff(dec);

Htppm:  Module:  yes 
Sequence:  tancpx.c      
Description:  Implements TPPM decoupling on the dec channel during 
              acquisition.  
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aHtppm - amplitude of the dec channel. 
       pwHtppm - approximate 180-degree flip angle on resonance. 
       phHtppm - +/- small angle phase. TPPM is implemented 
              with phases = +/- 1.0 times phHtppm for alternating pulses.
       chHtppm = 'dec' must be set (not shown).
Implementation: TPPM dec = gettppm("H"); or DSEQ dec = getdseq("H");
Underscore functions: _tppmon(dec); and decprgoff(); or _dseqon(dec);
              and _dseqoff(dec);
