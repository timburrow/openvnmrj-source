Description: 

     Constant, linear or tangent-ramped CP from H to X followed by 2D

90H:  Module:  no
Sequence:  tancpx.c
Description:  Provides a 90-degree pulse on dec that can be used as a
              preparation pulse. Also used to store the dec calibration.
Parameters:  Channels Page
      aH90  - the amplitude of the pulse.
      pwH90 - the pulse length.

cpHX:  Module:  yes
Sequence:  tancpx.c
Description:  Implements constant, linear or tangent-ramped cross
              polarization from dec to obs.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       shHX - 'c', constant, 'l', linear and 't', tangent shape on the
              channel designated with chHX.
       chHX - the variable-amplitude channel, 'fr' from or 'to', to.
       aHhx - median amplitude of the dec channel.
       aXhx - median amplitude of the obs channel.
       bHX - +/- tangent curvature (>0 to 1.0e5).
       dHX - amplitude width of the ramp. A negative width sets a ramp
              that starts high and decreases in amplitude.
       tHX - contact time
       ofHX - overall offset on the variable channel
       frHX = 'dec' -  channel with the initial polarization (must be
              set - not shown).
       toHX = 'obs' -  channel with the final polarization (must be set
              - not shown).
Implementation:  CP hx = getcp("HX",0.0,0.0,0,1);
Underscore function: _cp_(hx,phHhx,phXhx); phHhx is the overall phase
              table for the H channel and phXhx is that for the X channel.
