Protocol: Cpinad2d  Sequence: cpinad2d.c  Apptype: solidseq1d

Description:

   A "X" 2D INADEQUATE (1Q-2Q) correlation experiment with tangent CP
   preparation of "X", with TPPM or SPINAL decoupling.  Pulses can 
   potentially be rotor synchronized.

Parameter Groups

90H:  Module:  no
Sequence:  tancpx.c
Description:  Provides a 90-degree pulse on dec that can be used
              as a preparation pulse. Also used to store the dec
              calibration.
Parameters:  Channels Page
       aH90  - the amplitude of the pulse.
       pwH90 - the pulse length.

cpHX:  Module:  yes
Sequence:  tancpx.c
Description:  Implements constant, linear or tangent-ramped cross
              polarization from dec to obs.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       shHX - 'c', constant, 'l', linear and 't', tangent shape on
               the channel designated with chHX.
       chHX - the variable-amplitude channel, 'fr' from or 'to', to.
       aHhx - median amplitude of the dec channel.
       aXhx - median amplitude of the obs channel.
       bHX -  +/- tangent curvature (>0 to 1.0e5).
       dHX -  amplitude width of the ramp. A negative width sets a
              ramp that starts high and decreases in amplitude.
       tHX -  contact time
       ofHX - overall offset on the variable channel
       frHX = 'dec' -  channel with the initial polarization (must
              be set - not shown).
       toHX = 'obs' -  channel with the final polarization (must be
              set - not shown).
Implementation:  CP hx = getcp("HX",0.0,0.0,0,1);
Underscore functions: _cp_(hx,phHhx,phXhx);

inadX:  Module:  no
Sequence: cpinad2d.c
Description:  Implements a refocused INADEQUATE sequence with an F1
              delay d2 for double quantum evolution.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aXinad - amplitude of the obs pulse.
       pw1Xinad - 180-degree flip angle on the obs channel.
       pw2Xinad - 90-degree flip angle on the obs channel.
       t1Xinad - delay for J-evolution.
       t2Xinad - delay for J-refocusing.

Hseq:  Module:  yes
Sequence:  tancpx.c
Description: Chooses SPINAL or TPPM decoupling on the dec channel
             during acquisition
Parameters:  Sequence Page - the Hspinal and Htppm groups overlap
       Hseq - chooses the decoupling sequence, TPPM or SPINAL.
Implementation:  DSEQ dec = getdseq("H");  The router implements
             getspinal() or gettppm().
Underscore functions: _dseqon(dec); runs _tppm(); or _spinal();_
             dseqoff(dec); runs decprgoff();

Hspinal:  Module:  yes
Sequence: tancpx.c
Description:  Implements SPINAL decouping on the dec channel during
              acquisition.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aHspinal - amplitude of the dec channel.
       pwHspinal - approximate 180-degree flip angle on resonance.
       phHspinal - +/- small angle phase. SPINAL64 is implemented
              with phases = +/- 1.0, +/- 1.5 and +/-2.0 times
              phHspinal.
       chHspinal = 'dec' must be set (not shown).
Implementation: SPINAL dec = getspinal("H"); or DSEQ dec =
              getdseq("H");
Underscore functions: _spinal(dec); and decprgoff(); or
             _dseqon(dec); and _dseqoff(dec);

Htppm:  Module:  yes

Description:  Implements TPPM decoupling on the dec channel during
              acquisition.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aHtppm - amplitude of the dec channel.
       pwHtppm - approximate 180-degree flip angle on resonance.
       phHtppm - +/- small angle phase. TPPM is implemented
              with phases = +/- 1.0 times phHtppm for alternating
              pulses.
       chHtppm = 'dec' must be set (not shown).
