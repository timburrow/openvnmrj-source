Protocol: Br24  Sequence: br24.c  Apptype: solidseq1d

Description:

   "X" acquisition with interleaved BR24. Non-quadrature phase cycle.

Additional Software:

reset_br24 - This macro uses the calibrated values of pwX90 and aX90 
to calculate the initial parameters for br24X.  This macro is run from
the protocol.

Parameter Groups:

prepX:  Module:  no
Sequence:  br24q.c
Description:  Implements a variable length pulse to provide quadrature
              detection about a tilted precession axis. Typically followed
              by a windowed multiple-pulse acquisition.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aXprep - the amplitude of the obs pulses.
       pwXprep - 90-degree flip on the obs channel.
       phXprep - small-angle phase offset of the pulse. The phase must
              be reset to zero after the pulse.

scaleX: (processing)  Module:  no
Sequence:  br24.c
Description:  Shows the F2 scale factor, scalesw, for evolution of the
              obs nuclei under a multiple-pulse waveform.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       scalesw - the F2 scale factor. Typically scalesw is the inverse
              of the mutiple-pulse scale factor.

br24X: Module:  yes
Sequence:  br24.c 
Description:  Implements BR24 on obs with acquisition in the first
              window.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aXbr24 - amplitude of obs pulses.
       pwXbr24 - 90-degree flip on obs.
       r1Xbr24 - pre-pulse delay (similar to rof1).
       r2Xbr24 - post_pulse delay (similar to rd or rof2).
       r3Xbr24 - T/R-to-rcvron delay (must equal rof3 or 2.0 us if rof3
              is not defined). 
       tauXbr24 - time for one "one-tau" window and pulse.
       npaXbr24 - number of 100 ns ticks in the detection window.
       chXbr24 = 'obs' must be set (not shown).
 Implementation:  WMPA br24 = getbr24("br24X");
 Underscore function: _br24(br24,phXbr24);  phXbr24 is the overall
              phase table.
