Protocol: Lgfmcp1d  Sequence: lgfmcp1d.c  Apptype: solidseq1d

Description:

H Lee-Goldburg cross polarization (CP) with a sinusoidal frequency 
modulated (SFM) pulse on X with a choice of SPINAL or TPPM decoupling.
Used for selective CP with suppression of homonuclear dipolar 
interaction. The SFM pulse can lengthen T1rho.  

Parameter Groups:

90H:  Module:  no
Sequence:  tancpx.c
Description:  Provides a 90-degree pulse on dec that can be used as a
              preparation pulse. Also used to store the dec calibration.
Parameters:  Channels Page
       aH90  - the amplitude of the pulse.
       pwH90 - the pulse length.

lgH:  Module: yes
Sequence:  lgcp2d.c
Description:  Implements cw decoupling on H with an offset, used for
              Lee-Goldburg decoupling and spinlocks.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aHlg - amplitude of the FSLG dec pulses.
       qHlg - FSLG cycles represented in the .DEC file.
       ofHlg - overall frequency offset.
       chHfslg = 'dec' must be set (not shown).
Implementation: MPSEQ xlg = getlg("lgH",0,0.0,0.0,0,1);
Underscore functions: _MPSEQ functions.

sfmX:  Module:  yes
Sequence:  lgfmcp1d.c 
Description:  Implements a "sinusoidal frequency modulated , SFM, 
              pulse on the obs channel.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aXsfm - amplitude of obs SFM pulse.
       pwXsfm - width of the SFM pulse - one sin cycle is 
                executed during pwXsfm. 
       of1Xsfm - total frequency excursion 
       ofXsfm - center frequency. 
       chXsfm = 'obs' must be set (not shown).
Implementation:  SHAPE sfm = getsfm("sfmX",0,0.0,0.0,0,1);
Underscore function: _shape(sfm, phXsfm);

Hseq:  Module:  yes
Sequence: tancpx.c
Description:  Chooses SPINAL or TPPM decoupling on the dec channel
              during acquisition.
Parameters: Sequence Page - the Hspinal and Htppm groups overlap.
       Hseq - chooses the decoupling sequence, TPPM or SPINAL.
Implementation:  DSEQ dec = getdseq("H");  The router implements
              getspinal() or gettppm().
Underscore functions: _dseqon(dec); runs _tppm(); or _spinal();
              _dseqoff(dec); runs decprgoff();

Hspinal: Module:  yes
Sequence:  tancpx.c
Description:  Implements SPINAL decoupling on the dec channel during
              acquisition.
Parameters: Sequence Page
       aHspinal - amplitude of the dec channel.
       pwHspinal - approximate 180-degree flip angle on resonance.
       phHspinal - +/- small angle phase. SPINAL64 is implemented with
              phases = +/- 1.0, +/- 1.5 and +/-2.0 times phHspinal.
       chHspinal = 'dec' must be set (not shown).
Implementation: SPINAL dec = getspinal("H"); or DSEQ dec =
              getdseq("H");
Underscore functions: _spinal(dec); and decprgoff(); or _dseqon(dec);
              and _dseqoff(dec);

Htppm:  Module:  yes
Sequence:  tancpx.c
Description: Implements TPPM decoupling on the dec channel during
             acquisition.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aHtppm - amplitude of the dec channel.
       pwHtppm - approximate 180-degree flip angle on resonance.
       phHtppm - +/- small angle phase. TPPM is implemented
             with phases = +/- 1.0 times phHtppm for alternating pulses.
       chHtppm = 'dec' must be set (not shown).
Implementation: TPPM dec = gettppm("H"); or DSEQ dec = getdseq("H");
