Protocol: R14inad2d  Sequence: r14inad2d.c  Apptype: solidseq1d

Description:
  
   1Q-2Q "X" correlation using R14 mixing, with TPPM or SPINAL 
   decoupling. 

Additional Software: 

reset_r14 - This macro uses the calibrated values of pwX90, aX90 and 
srate to set up the R14 recoupling sequence.  The amplitude aHmix is set
to aH90. The macro is executed by the protocol.
 
Parameter  Groups: 

90H:  Module:  no
Sequence:  tancpx.c  
Description:  Provides a 90-degree pulse on dec that can be used 
              as a preparation pulse. Also used to store the dec 
              calibration.
Parameters:  Channels Page
       aH90  - the amplitude of the pulse.
       pwH90 - the pulse length.

cpHX:  Module:  yes
Sequence:  tancpx.c
Description:  Implements constant, linear or tangent-ramped cross 
              polarization from dec to obs. 
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       shHX - 'c', constant, 'l', linear and 't', tangent shape on
               the channel designated with chHX. 
       chHX - the variable-amplitude channel, 'fr' from or 'to', to. 
       aHhx - median amplitude of the dec channel.
       aXhx - median amplitude of the obs channel.
       bHX -  +/- tangent curvature (>0 to 1.0e5).  
       dHX -  amplitude width of the ramp. A negative width sets a
              ramp that starts high and decreases in amplitude.
       tHX -  contact time
       ofHX - overall offset on the variable channel
       frHX = 'dec' -  channel with the initial polarization (must 
              be set - not shown).           
       toHX = 'obs' -  channel with the final polarization (must be
              set - not shown). 
Implementation:  CP hx = getcp("HX",0.0,0.0,0,1); 
Underscore functions: _cp_(hx,phHhx,phXhx);  

r14X:  Module:  yes
Sequence:  r14inad2d.c     
Description:  Implements the R1462 recoupling sequence on the obs
              channel.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aXr14 - amplitude of obs pulses.
       pwXr14 - 360-degree flip on obs.
       qXr14 - R14 cycles represented in the .DEC file.
       ofXr14 - overall frequency offset.
       chXr14 = 'obs' must be set (not shown).
Implementation: MPSEQ r14 = getr1462("r14X",0,0.0,0.0,0,1);
Underscore functions: _MPSEQ functions.

Hseq:  Module:  yes 
Sequence:  tancpx.c      
Description: Chooses SPINAL or TPPM decoupling on the dec channel 
             during acquisition.
Parameters:  Sequence Page - the Hspinal and Htppm groups overlap.
       Hseq - chooses the decoupling sequence, TPPM or SPINAL. 
Implementation:  DSEQ dec = getdseq("H");  The router implements 
             getspinal() or gettppm(). 
Underscore functions: _dseqon(dec); runs _tppm(); or _spinal();_

Hspinal:  Module:  yes 
Sequence: tancpx.c

              acquisition.  
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aHspinal - amplitude of the dec channel. 
       pwHspinal - approximate 180-degree flip angle on resonance. 
       phHspinal - +/- small angle phase. SPINAL64 is implemented 
              with phases = +/- 1.0, +/- 1.5 and +/-2.0 times 
              phHspinal. 
       chHspinal = 'dec' must be set (not shown).
Implementation: SPINAL dec = getspinal("H"); or DSEQ dec = 
              getdseq("H");
