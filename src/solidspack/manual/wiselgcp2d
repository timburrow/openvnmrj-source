Protocol: Wiselgcp2d  Sequence: wiselgcp2d.c  Apptype: solidseq1d

Description: 

2D correlation between the X chemical shift and the proton wideline 
spectrum using constant, linear or tangent-ramped Lee Goldburg cross 
polarization (CP) between proton and X with a choice of H SPINAL64 or
TPPM decoupling during acquisition and a choice of X SPINAL64 or TPPM 
decoupling on H. 
 
Used for separation of the proton wideline spectra of 13C-1H pairs with 
tHmix = 0 and for spin diffusion measurements with tHmix > 0.0.  

Additional Software: 

reset_wiselgcp2d - This macro sets par2d and is run with the protocol. 

Setup: 

Load a calibrated data set and select the protocol Wiselgcp2d. For a 
new nucleus calibrate CP with Onepul and Lgcp and then select 
Wiselgcp2d. Calibration of Lee-Goldburg CP (LGcp) is described in the 
manual file lgcp.  

Select the desired H decoupling method, TPPM or SPINAL. The manual file 
onepul describes calibration of decoupling. 

If desired select the X decoupling method, TPPM or SPINAL. X decoupling 
is necessary because Lee-Goldburg CP only selects CP from protons with 
directly attached 13C nuclei and these nuclei are broadened by 13C-1H 
coupling.  Spinning partially reduces this coupling but may leave 
sidebands in F1. X decoupling will not alwys be necessary. 

Select 2D acquisition on the Acquisition page and set sw1 = 2.0e5 to 
5.0e5. Set ni = 32 and phase = 1,2. 

Select a spin diffusion mixing period tHmix = 0 if the goal is just to 
separate wideline data in the second dimension.  Motionally averaged 
groups have narrow wideline spectra and rigid groups have spectra of 
the order of 50 kHz wide. Set tHmix > 0.0 to correlate domains of 
motion with rigid domains through spin diffusion.  tHmix is short (0.0 
to 1.0 ms) to correlate molecular sites and can be greater to correlate 
large domains. 

Collect a 2D spectrum and process with wft2da.

       aH90  - the amplitude of the pulse.
       pwH90 - the pulse length.

              polarization from dec to obs.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       shHX - 'c', constant, 'l', linear and 't', tangent shape on the 
              channel designated with chHX.

       aHhx - median amplitude of the dec channel.
       aXhx - median amplitude of the obs channel.
       bHX - +/- tangent curvature (>0 to 1.0e5).

              that starts high and decreases in amplitude.
       tHX - contact time
       ofHX - overall offset on the variable channel
       frHX = 'dec' -  channel with the initial polarization (must be 
              set - not shown).

pwHtilt - parameter - tilts the proton magnetization 35.3 degrees
                      to the magic angle for Lee-Goldburg CP. The
                      amplitude of this pulse is determined by aH90.
