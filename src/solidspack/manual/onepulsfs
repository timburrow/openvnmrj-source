Protocol: Onepulsfs  Sequence: onepulsfs.c  Apptype: solidseq1d

Description:

    A onepulse experiment on "X" with a single-frequency sweep preparation
    pulse for enhancement of sensitivity through population transfer, with 
    SPINAL and TPPM decoupling.

Parameter Groups: 

sfsX:  Module:  yes
Sequence:  onepulsfs.c 
Description:  Implements a "single frequency sweep", SFS, pulse on the
              obs channel.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aXsfs - amplitude of obs DFS pulse.
       pwXsfs - width of the DFS pulse.
       of1Xsfs - initial frequency.
       of2Xsfs - final frequency.
       ofXsfs - center frequency. 
       chXsfs = 'obs' must be set (not shown).
Implementation:  SHAPE sfs = getsfs("sfsX",0,0.0,0.0,0,1);
Underscore function: _shape(sfs, phXsfs);

90X:  Module:  no
Sequence:  onepul.c    
Description:  Provides a 90-degree pulse on obs that can be used 
              as a preparation pulse. Also used to store the obs 
              calibration.
Parameters:  Channels Page
      aX90  - the amplitude of the pulse.
      pwX90 - the pulse length.

Hseq:  Module:  yes 
Sequence:  tancpx.c      
Description: Chooses SPINAL or TPPM decoupling on the dec channel 
             during acquisition.
Parameters:  Sequence Page - the Hspinal and Htppm groups overlap.
       Hseq - chooses the decoupling sequence, TPPM or SPINAL. 
Implementation:  DSEQ dec = getdseq("H");  The router implements 
             getspinal() or gettppm(). 
Underscore functions: _dseqon(dec); runs _tppm(); or _spinal();_
             dseqoff(dec); runs decprgoff();  

Hspinal:  Module:  yes 
Sequence: tancpx.c  
Description:  Implements SPINAL decoupling on the dec channel during 
              acquisition.  
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aHspinal - amplitude of the dec channel. 
       pwHspinal - approximate 180-degree flip angle on resonance. 
       phHspinal - +/- small angle phase. SPINAL64 is implemented 
              with phases = +/- 1.0, +/- 1.5 and +/-2.0 times 
              phHspinal. 
       chHspinal = 'dec' must be set (not shown).
Implementation: SPINAL dec = getspinal("H"); or DSEQ dec = 
              getdseq("H");  
Underscore functions: _spinal(dec); and decprgoff(); or 
             _dseqon(dec); and _dseqoff(dec);   

Htppm:  Module:  yes 
Sequence:  tancpx.c      
Description:  Implements TPPM decoupling on the dec channel during 
              acquisition.  
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aHtppm - amplitude of the dec channel. 
       pwHtppm - approximate 180-degree flip angle on resonance. 
       phHtppm - +/- small angle phase. TPPM is implemented 
              with phases = +/- 1.0 times phHtppm for alternating 
              pulses.  
       chHtppm = 'dec' must be set (not shown).
Implementation: TPPM dec = gettppm("H"); or DSEQ dec = getdseq("H");   
Underscore functions: _tppmon(dec); and decprgoff(); or _dseqon(dec);
              and _dseqoff(dec);
