   with "X" RAD mixing and with TPPM or SPINAL decoupling.

Parameter Groups

90H:  Module:  no
Sequence:  tancpx.c
Description:  Provides a 90-degree pulse on dec that can be used as a
              preparation pulse. Also used to store the dec calibration.
Parameters:  Channels Page
      aH90  - the amplitude of the pulse.
      pwH90 - the pulse length.

cpHY:  Module:  yes
Sequence:  dcptan.c
Description:  Implements constant, linear or tangent-ramped cross
              polarization from dec to dec2.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       shHY - 'c', constant, 'l', linear and 't', tangent shape on the
              channel designated with
                      chHY.
       chHY - the variable-amplitude channel, 'fr' from or 'to', to.
       aHhy - median amplitude of the dec channel.
       aXhy - median amplitude of the dec2 channel.
       bHY - tangent curvature (>0 to 1.0e5).
       dHY - +/- amplitude width of the ramp. A negative width sets a
              ramp that starts high and decreases in amplitude.
       tHY - contact time.
       ofHY - overall offset on the variable channel.
       frHY = 'dec' - channel with the initial polarization (must be
              set - not shown).   
       toHY = 'dec2' - channel with the final polarization (must be set
              - not shown).
Implementation: CP hy = getcp("HY",0.0,0.0,0,1);
Underscore function: _cp_(hy,phHhx,phYhy); phHhx is the overall phase
              table for the H channel and phYhy is that for the Y channel.

              polarization from dec2 to obs.

       shYX - 'c', constant, 'l', linear and 't', tangent shape on the
              channel designated with chYX.
       chYX - the variable-amplitude channel, 'fr' from or 'to', to.
       aYyx - median amplitude of the dec2 channel.
       aXyx - median amplitude of the obs channel.
       bYX - tangent curvature (>0 to 1.0e5).
       dYX - +/- amplitude width of the ramp. A negative width sets a
              ramp that starts high and decreases in amplitude.
       tYX - contact time.
       ofYX - overall offset on the variable channel.
       frYX = 'dec2' - channel with the initial polarization (must be
              set - not shown).
       toYX = 'obs' - channel with the final polarization (must be set
              - not shown).

Underscore function: _cp_(yx,phYyx,phXhx); phYyx is the overall phase
              table for the Y channel and phXhx is that for the X channel.

mixX:  Module:  no
Sequence:  tancp2drad.c
Description:  Implements a mixing delay in sequences where mixing occurs
              among the obs nuclei. CW decoupling is allowed on DEC.
              Typically used for DARR (RAD) mixing periods where decoupling
              at a field strength of srate/2.0 enhances obs spin diffusion.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       tXmix - the mixing delay time. The delay may or may not be rotor
              synchronized, depending on the sequence.
       aHmix - amplitude of decoupling.

Hseq:  Module:  yes
