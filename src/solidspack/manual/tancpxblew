Protocol: Tancpxblew  Sequence: tancpxblew.c  Apptype: solidseq1d

Description: 

   "X" tangent CP preparation with BLEW24 decoupling during acquisition.

Additional Software: 

   reset_blew - rests the values of BLEW from aH90 and pwH90. 

Parameter Groups: 

90H:  Module:  no
Sequence:  tancpx.c  
Description:  Provides a 90-degree pulse on dec that can be used as a 
              preparation pulse.  Also used to store the dec calibration.
Parameters:  Channels Page
       aH90  - the amplitude of the pulse.
       pwH90 - the pulse length.

cpHX:  Module:  yes
Sequence:  tancpx.c
Description:  Implements constant, linear or tangent-ramped cross 
              polarization from dec to obs. 
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       shHX - 'c', constant, 'l', linear and 't', tangent shape on the 
channel designated with 
                      chHX. 
       chHX - the variable-amplitude channel, 'fr' from or 'to', to. 
       aHhx - median amplitude of the dec channel.
       aXhx - median amplitude of the obs channel.
       bHX - +/- tangent curvature (>0 to 1.0e5).  
       dHX - amplitude width of the ramp. A negative width sets a ramp 
              that starts high and decreases in amplitude.
       tHX - contact time
       ofHX - overall offset on the variable channel
       frHX = 'dec' -  channel with the initial polarization (must be 
             set - not shown).           
       toHX = 'obs' -  channel with the final polarization (must be set 
             - not shown). 
Implementation:  CP hx = getcp("HX",0.0,0.0,0,1); 
Underscore functions: _cp_(hx,phHhx,phxhx);

blewH:  Module:  yes
Sequence:  tancpxblew.c
Description:  Implements BLEW24 homonuclear decoupling on the dec
              channel
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aHblew - amplitude of dec pulses.
       pwHblew - 360-degree flip on dec, on resonance.
       nHblew - BLEW24 cycles represented in the .DEC file.
       ofHblew - overall frequency offset.
       chHblew = 'dec' must be set (not shown).
Implementation: MPSEQ blew = getblew("blewH",0,0.0,0.0,0,1);
Underscore functions: _MPSEQ functions.
