Protocol: Wdumbot1d  Sequence: wdumbot1d.c  Apptype: solidseq1d

Description: 
 
   A 1D acquisition with windowed DUMBO on "X", using tilt pulses around the 
   windows, wDUMBOt. 

Additional Software 

   reset_wdumbot1d - Sets aXwdumbot and pwXwdumbot to create a 6-pi 
   DUMBO pulse. Set the window tauXwdumbo1d to be at least 4 us with 
   a 1 us of receiver on. Reset scalesw to 1/sqrt(3) the nominal scale 
   factor.  Set the prep1 pulses form aX90 and pwX90. Set r1=.5, r2=.5
   and r3 = .5 for wdumbotX. 

Parameter Groups:

prepX:  Module:  no
Sequence:  br24q.c
Description:  Implements a variable length pulse to provide quadrature
              detection about a tilted precession axis. Typically
              followed by a windowed multiple-pulse acquisition.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aXprep - the amplitude of the obs pulses.
       pwXprep - 90-degree flip on the obs channel.
       phXprep - small-angle phase offset of the pulse. The phase must
              be reset to zero after the pulse.

scaleX: (processing)  Module:  no
Sequence:  br24.c
Description:  Shows the F2 scale factor, scalesw, for evolution of the
              obs nuclei under a multiple-pulse waveform.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       scalesw - the F2 scale factor. Typically scalesw is the inverse
              of the mutiple-pulse scale factor.

wdumbotX:  Module:  yes
Sequence:   wdumbot1d.c
Description:  Implements windowed DUMBO homonuclear decoupling on obs
              with acquisition in the window.  Tilt pulses around the
              acquisition window allow non-quadrature detection.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aXwdumbot - amplitude of DUMBO on obs.
       pw1Xwdumbot - 1080-degree flip on obs (the length of a full
              DUMBO cycle).
       pw2Xwdumbot - nominal 54.7-degree flip on obs for tilt pulses.
       r1Xwdumbot - prepulse delay (similar to rof1).
       r2Xwdumbot - postpulse delay (similar to rd or rof2).
       r3Xwdumbot - T/R-to-rcvron delay (must equal rof3 or 2.0 us if
              rof3 is not defined).
       tauXwdumbot - time for one DUMBO cycle including the window.
       npaXwdumbot - number of 100 ns ticks in the detection window.
       phXwdumbot - overall small-angle phase for DUMBO to align the
              tilted precession axis in the XY plane.
       chXwdumbot = 'obs' must be set (not shown).
Implementation:  WMPA wdumbot = getwdumbot("wdumbotX");
Underscore function: _wdumbot(wdumbot,phXwdumbot);  phXwdumbot is the
              overall phase table.
