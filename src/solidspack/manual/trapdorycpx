Protocol: Trapdorycpx  Sequence: trapdorycpx.c  Apptype: solidseq1d

Description:

Trapdor on H with Y modulation followed by CP to X with SPINAL 
or TPPM decoupling.

Parameter  Groups:

trapHY:  Module:  no
Sequence:  trapdorycpx.c 
Description:  Implements a two-pulse TRAPDOR sequence with an echo on
              dec and a tramsitter pulse on dec2 in the first tau period.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aHhytrap - amplitude of the dec channel.
       aXhytrap - amplitude of the dec2 channel.
       pw1Hhytrap - first pulse on dec.
       t1HYtrap - first tau period - dec2 transmitter on.
       pw2Hhytrap - second pulse on dec.
       t2HYtrap - second tau period.

cpHX:  Module:  yes
Sequence:  tancpx.c
Description:  Implements constant, linear or tangent-ramped cross 
              polarization from dec to obs. 
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       shHX - 'c', constant, 'l', linear and 't', tangent shape on
               the channel designated with chHX. 
       chHX - the variable-amplitude channel, 'fr' from or 'to', to. 
       aHhx - median amplitude of the dec channel.
       aXhx - median amplitude of the obs channel.
       bHX -  +/- tangent curvature (>0 to 1.0e5).  
       dHX -  amplitude width of the ramp. A negative width sets a
              ramp that starts high and decreases in amplitude.
       tHX -  contact time
       ofHX - overall offset on the variable channel
       frHX = 'dec' -  channel with the initial polarization (must 
              be set - not shown).           
       toHX = 'obs' -  channel with the final polarization (must be
              set - not shown). 
Implementation:  CP hx = getcp("HX",0.0,0.0,0,1); 
Underscore functions: _cp_(hx, phHhx, phXhx);  
 
Hseq:  Module:  yes 
Sequence:  tancpx.c      
Description: Chooses SPINAL or TPPM decoupling on the dec channel 
             during acquisition.
Parameters:  Sequence Page - the Hspinal and Htppm groups overlap.
       Hseq - chooses the decoupling sequence, TPPM or SPINAL. 
Implementation:  DSEQ dec = getdseq("H");  The router implements 
             getspinal() or gettppm(). 
Underscore functions: _dseqon(dec); runs _tppm(); or _spinal();_
             dseqoff(dec); runs decprgoff();  

Hspinal:  Module:  yes 
Sequence: tancpx.c  
Description:  Implements SPINAL decoupling on the dec channel during 
              acquisition.  
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aHspinal - amplitude of the dec channel. 
       pwHspinal - approximate 180-degree flip angle on resonance. 
       phHspinal - +/- small angle phase. SPINAL64 is implemented 
              with phases = +/- 1.0, +/- 1.5 and +/-2.0 times 
              phHspinal. 
       chHspinal = 'dec' must be set (not shown).
Implementation: SPINAL dec = getspinal("H"); or DSEQ dec = 
              getdseq("H");  
Underscore functions: _spinal(dec); and decprgoff(); or 
             _dseqon(dec); and _dseqoff(dec);   

Htppm:  Module:  yes 
Sequence:  tancpx.c      
Description:  Implements TPPM decoupling on the dec channel during 
              acquisition.  
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aHtppm - amplitude of the dec channel. 
       pwHtppm - approximate 180-degree flip angle on resonance. 
       phHtppm - +/- small angle phase. TPPM is implemented 
              with phases = +/- 1.0 times phHtppm for alternating 
              pulses.  
       chHtppm = 'dec' must be set (not shown).
Implementation: TPPM dec = gettppm("H"); or DSEQ dec = getdseq("H");   
Underscore functions: _tppmon(dec); and decprgoff(); or _dseqon(dec);
              and _dseqoff(dec);
