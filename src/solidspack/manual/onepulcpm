Protocol: Onepulcpm  Sequence: onepulcpm.c  Apptype: solidseq1d

Description: 

Single pulse preparation with CPM (eDROOPY) decoupling.
Used for calibration of the 90-degree pulse-width pwX90. 

Uses the cpmH SHAPE module instead of the DSEQ router. 

Setup: 

Load a calibrated data set and select the protocol Onepulcpm. For a 
new nucleus set the desired observe nucleus and array pwX90 to 
obtain a calibration. 

Select the desired decoupling method "OFF", "CW" or "PM". 

If no decoupling is desired select OFF.   

If CW decoupling is desired select CW. 

If CPM decoupling is desired select PM. The cpmH parameter 
group will appear. 
 
Set aHcpm to the desired amplitude 0 to 4095.  Set pwHcpm to 
just less than the 180-degree pulse width for the field 
strength provided by aHcpm. Set phHcpm to about 8.0 degrees.  
Array pwHcpm and phHcpm for a fine calibration.  Choose the 
narrowest line with the greatest amplitude. Glycine is a 
good standard for CPM calibration. 

Parameter Groups:

90X:  Module:  no
Sequence:  onepul.c    
Description:  Provides a 90-degree pulse on obs that can be used 
              as a preparation pulse. Also used to store the obs 
              calibration.
Parameters:  Channels Page
      aX90  - the amplitude of the pulse.
      pwX90 - the pulse length.

cpmH:  Module:  yes
Sequence:  tancpxcpm.c
Description: Implements CPM Decoupling - Used as an alternate to the DSEQ router.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aHcpm - amplitude of CPM.
       pwHcpm - approximate 180-degree flip on dec.
       phHcpm - CPM +/- phase, "phi".
       ofHspnl - overall frequency offset.
Implementation: SHAPE cpm = getcpm("cpmH",0.0,0.0,0,1);
Underscore functions: _SHAPE functions.
