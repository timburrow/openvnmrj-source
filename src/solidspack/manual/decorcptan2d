Protocol: Decorcptancp2d  Sequence: decorcptan2d.c  Apptype: solidseq1d

Description:

   One-pulse prep on the "Y" channel with "Y" to "X" CP and "X" observe, with
   SPINAL or TPPM decoupling.

Parameter Groups

90Y:  Module:  no
Sequence:  none
Description:  Provides a 90-degree pulse on dec2 that can be used as a
              preparation pulse. Also used to store the dec2 calibration.
Parameters:  Channels Page
       aY90  - the amplitude of the pulse.
       pwY90 - the pulse length.

cpYX:  Module:  yes
Sequence: dcptan.c
Description:  Implements constant, linear or tangent-ramped cross
              polarization from dec2 to obs.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       shYX - 'c', constant, 'l', linear and 't', tangent shape on the
              channel designated with chYX.
       chYX - the variable-amplitude channel, 'fr' from or 'to', to.
       aYyx - median amplitude of the dec2 channel.
       aXyx - median amplitude of the obs channel.
       bYX - tangent curvature (>0 to 1.0e5).
       dYX - +/- amplitude width of the ramp. A negative width sets a
              ramp that starts high and decreases in amplitude.
       tYX - contact time.
       ofYX - overall offset on the variable channel.
       frYX = 'dec2' - channel with the initial polarization (must be
              set - not shown).
       toYX = 'obs' - channel with the final polarization (must be set
              - not shown).
Implementation: CP yx = getcp("YX",0.0,0.0,0,1);
Underscore function: _cp_(yx,phYyx,phXhx); phYyx is the overall phase
              table for the Y channel and phXhx is that for the X channel.       

Hseq:  Module:  yes
Sequence:  tancpx.c
Description: Chooses SPINAL or TPPM decoupling on the dec channel
             during acquisition
Parameters:  Sequence Page - the Hspinal and Htppm groups overlap
       Hseq - chooses the decoupling sequence, TPPM or SPINAL.
Implementation:  DSEQ dec = getdseq("H");  The router implements
             getspinal() or gettppm().
Underscore functions: _dseqon(dec); runs _tppm(); or _spinal();_
             dseqoff(dec); runs decprgoff();

Hspinal:  Module:  yes
Sequence: tancpx.c 
Description:  Implements SPINAL decouping on the dec channel during
              acquisition.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aHspinal - amplitude of the dec channel.
       pwHspinal - approximate 180-degree flip angle on resonance.
       phHspinal - +/- small angle phase. SPINAL64 is implemented
              with phases = +/- 1.0, +/- 1.5 and +/-2.0 times
              phHspinal.
       chHspinal = 'dec' must be set (not shown).
Implementation: SPINAL dec = getspinal("H"); or DSEQ dec =
              getdseq("H");
Underscore functions: _spinal(dec); and decprgoff(); or
             _dseqon(dec); and _dseqoff(dec);

Htppm:  Module:  yes
Sequence:  tancpx.c
Description:  Implements TPPM decoupling on the dec channel during
              acquisition.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aHtppm - amplitude of the dec channel.
       pwHtppm - approximate 180-degree flip angle on resonance.
       phHtppm - +/- small angle phase. TPPM is implemented
              with phases = +/- 1.0 times phHtppm for alternating
              pulses.
       chHtppm = 'dec' must be set (not shown).
Implementation: TPPM dec = gettppm("H"); or DSEQ dec = getdseq("H");
Underscore functions: _tppmon(dec); and decprgoff(); or _dseqon(dec);
              and _dseqoff(dec);
