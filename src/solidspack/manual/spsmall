Protocol: Spsmall  Sequence: spsmall.c  Apptype: solidseq1d

Description: 

Single-pulse sequence for testing the small-angle phase shifter
with a choice of SPINAL64 or TPPM decoupling. 

Parameter Groups:

90X:  Module:  no
Sequence:  onepul.c    
Description:  Provides a 90-degree pulse on obs that can be used 
              as a preparation pulse. Also used to store the obs 
              calibration.
Parameters:  Channels Page
      aX90  - the amplitude of the pulse.
      pwX90 - the pulse length.

phfXsmall: Small angle phase of pwX90. 

Hseq:  Module:  yes 
Sequence:  tancpx.c      
Description:  Chooses SPINAL or TPPM decoupling on the dec channel
              during acquisition.  
Parameters:  Sequence Page - Hspinal and Htppm groups overlap. 
       Hseq - chooses the decoupling sequence, TPPM or SPINAL. 
Implementation:  DSEQ dec = getdseq("H");  The router implements 
              getspinal() or gettppm(). 
Underscore functions: _dseqon(dec); runs _tppm(); or _spinal();
              _dseqoff(dec); runs decprgoff();  

Hspinal:  Module:  yes 
Sequence:  tancpx.c  
Description:  Implements SPINAL decoupling on the dec channel during 
              acquisition.  
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aHspinal - amplitude of the dec channel. 
       pwHspinal - approximate 180-degree flip angle on resonance. 
       phHspinal - +/- small angle phase. SPINAL64 is implemented 
              with phases = +/- 1.0, +/- 1.5 and +/-2.0 times phHspinal. 
       chHspinal = 'dec' must be set (not shown).
Implementation: SPINAL dec = getspinal("H"); or DSEQ dec = 
              getdseq("H");  
Underscore functions: _spinal(dec); and decprgoff(); or _dseqon(dec);
              and _dseqoff(dec);   

Htppm:  Module:  yes 
Sequence:  tancpx.c      
Description:  Implements TPPM decoupling on the dec channel during 
              acquisition.  
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aHtppm - amplitude of the dec channel. 
       pwHtppm - approximate 180-degree flip angle on resonance. 
       phHtppm - +/- small angle phase. TPPM is implemented 
              with phases = +/- 1.0 times phHtppm for alternating pulses.
       chHtppm = 'dec' must be set (not shown).
Implementation: TPPM dec = gettppm("H"); or DSEQ dec = getdseq("H");
Underscore functions: _tppmon(dec); and decprgoff(); or _dseqon(dec);
              and _dseqoff(dec);
