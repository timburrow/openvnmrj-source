Protocol: Wisetancp2d  Sequence: wisetancp2d.c  Apptype: solidseq1d

Description: 

2D correlation between the X chemical shift and the proton wideline 
spectrum using constant, linear or tangent-ramped cross polarization 
(CP) between proton and X with a choice of SPINAL64 or TPPM decoupling. 
Used for separation of the proton wideline spectra of 13C-1H pairs with 
tHmix = 0 and for spin diffusion measurements with tHmix > 0.0.  

Additional Software: 

reset_wisetancp2d - This macro sets par2d and is run with the protocol. 

Setup: 

Load a calibrated data set and select the protocol Wisetancp2d.   For a 
new nucleus calibrate CP with Onepul and Tancpx and the select 
Tancpxtoss.  

Select the desired decoupling method, TPPM or SPINAL. The manual file 
onepul describes calibration of decoupling. 

Select 2D acquisition on the Acquisition page and set sw1 = 2.0e5 to 
5.0e5. Set ni = 32 and phase =1,2. 

Select a spin diffusion mixing period tHmix = 0 if the goal is just to 
separate wideline data in the second dimension.  Motionally averaged 
groups have narrow wideline spectra and rigid groups have spectra of 
the order of 50 kHz wide. Set tHmix > 0.0 to correlate domains of 
motion with rigid domains through spin diffusion.  tHmix is short (0.0 
to 1.0 ms) to correlate molecular sites and can be greater to correlate 
large domains. 

Collect a 2D spectrum and process with wft2da. 

Parameter Groups: 

90H:  Module:  no
Sequence:  tancpx.c 
Description:  Provides a 90-degree pulse on dec that can be used as a
              preparation pulse. Also used to store the dec calibration.
Parameters:  Channels Page
       aH90  - the amplitude of the pulse.
       pwH90 - the pulse length.

cpHX:  Module:  yes
Sequence:  tancpx.c
Description:  Implements constant, linear or tangent-ramped cross
              polarization from dec to obs.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       shHX - 'c', constant, 'l', linear and 't', tangent shape on the 
              channel designated with chHX. 
       chHX - the variable-amplitude channel, 'fr' from or 'to', to. 
       aHhx - median amplitude of the dec channel.
       aXhx - median amplitude of the obs channel.
       bHX - +/- tangent curvature (>0 to 1.0e5).  
       dHX - amplitude width of the ramp. A negative width sets a ramp 
              that starts high and decreases in amplitude.
       tHX - contact time
       ofHX - overall offset on the variable channel
       frHX = 'dec' -  channel with the initial polarization (must be 
              set - not shown).           
       toHX = 'obs' -  channel with the final polarization (must be set 
              - not shown). 
Implementation:  CP hx = getcp("HX",0.0,0.0,0,1); 
Underscore functions: _cp_(hx,phHhx,phXhx);  

tHmix: - (parameter) the time for spin diffusion mixing.
