Protocol: Sammy2d  Sequence: sammy2d.c  Apptype: solidseq1d

Description: 

     A sequence to provide correlation between the chemical-shift and
     1H-dipolar interaction using a pair of magic sandwich spinlocks (SAMMY).  

     Uses a modified SAMMY sequence based on a personalcommunication by 
     Alex Nevzorov.  Changes from the paper are: 
                  1.  invert the X phase at the center of each MS cycle.  
                      That means the X durations are 6.0*pwX90, 12.0*pwX90, 6.0*pwX90. 
                  2.  set each of four H spinlocks = 3.5*pwH90 and the two delays
                      = 3.0*pwH90 each. The four explicit pwH90's fill 2 MS cycles. 
                  3.  del1 and del2 remain the same but should be zero.

Additional Software:

   reset_sammy - This macro uses the calibrated values of pwH90 and aH90 to 
      calculate the intial parameters for the smydH and smyoX  waveforms and 
      sets up 2D parameters. reset_sammy2d is run from the protocol. 

Parameter Groups:

90H:  Module:  no
Sequence:  tancpx.c  
Description:  Provides a 90-degree pulse on dec that can be used 
              as a preparation pulse. Also used to store the dec 
              calibration.
Parameters:  Channels Page
       aH90  - the amplitude of the pulse.
       pwH90 - the pulse length.

cpHX:  Module:  yes
Sequence:  tancpx.c
Description:  Implements constant, linear or tangent-ramped cross 
              polarization from dec to obs. 
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       shHX - 'c', constant, 'l', linear and 't', tangent shape on
               the channel designated with chHX. 
       chHX - the variable-amplitude channel, 'fr' from or 'to', to. 
       aHhx - median amplitude of the dec channel.
       aXhx - median amplitude of the obs channel.
       bHX -  +/- tangent curvature (>0 to 1.0e5).  
       dHX -  amplitude width of the ramp. A negative width sets a
              ramp that starts high and decreases in amplitude.
       tHX -  contact time
       ofHX - overall offset on the variable channel
       frHX = 'dec' -  channel with the initial polarization (must 
              be set - not shown).           
       toHX = 'obs' -  channel with the final polarization (must be
              set - not shown).
