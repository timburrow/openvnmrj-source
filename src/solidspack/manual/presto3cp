Protocol: Presto3cp  Sequence: presto3cp.c  Apptype: solidseq1d

Description: 

   A selective "X" to "H" CP using PRESTO3, R1825 on "H", with SPINAL or
   TPPM decoupling.

Additional Software

   reset_r18 - This macro uses the calibrated values of pwH90, aH90 and 
   srate to set up the R18 recoupling sequence. The macro is executed by 
   the protocol.

Parameter Groups:

90H:  Module:  no
Sequence:  tancpx.c  
Description:  Provides a 90-degree pulse on dec that can be used 
              as a preparation pulse. Also used to store the dec 
              calibration.
Parameters:  Channels Page
       aH90  - the amplitude of the pulse.
       pwH90 - the pulse length.

pto3HX:  Module:  no
Sequence:  presto3cp.c
Description:  Implements a PRESTO3 polarization transfer from dec to
              obs using R1825 on the dec channel. Requires implementation
              of r18H.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aXhxpto3 - the amplitude of the obs channel pulses.
       pw1Xhxpto3 - a 180-degree flip angle on the obs channel.
       pw2Xhxpto3 - a 90-degree flip angle on the obs channel.
       t1HXpto3 - delay around the first obs refocusing pulse.
       t2HXpto3 - delay around the second obs refocusing pulse.

r18H:  Module:  yes
Sequence:  presto1cp.c
Description:  Implements the R1825 recoupling sequence on the dec
              channel.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aHr18 - amplitude of dec pulses.
       pwHr18 - 360-degree flip on dec.
       qHr18 - R18 cycles represented in the .DEC file.
       ofHr18 - overall frequency offset.
       chHr18 = 'dec' must be set (not shown).
Implementation: MPSEQ r1825 = getr1825("r18H",0,0.0,0.0,0,1);
Underscore functions: _MPSEQ functions.

Hseq:  Module:  yes 
Sequence:  tancpx.c      
Description: Chooses SPINAL or TPPM decoupling on the dec channel 
             during acquisition.
Parameters:  Sequence Page - the Hspinal and Htppm groups overlap.
       Hseq - chooses the decoupling sequence, TPPM or SPINAL. 
Implementation:  DSEQ dec = getdseq("H");  The router implements 
             getspinal() or gettppm(). 
Underscore functions: _dseqon(dec); runs _tppm(); or _spinal();_
             dseqoff(dec); runs decprgoff();  

Hspinal:  Module:  yes 
Sequence: tancpx.c  
Description:  Implements SPINAL decoupling on the dec channel during 
              acquisition.  
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aHspinal - amplitude of the dec channel. 
       pwHspinal - approximate 180-degree flip angle on resonance. 
       phHspinal - +/- small angle phase. SPINAL64 is implemented 
              with phases = +/- 1.0, +/- 1.5 and +/-2.0 times 
              phHspinal. 
       chHspinal = 'dec' must be set (not shown).
Implementation: SPINAL dec = getspinal("H"); or DSEQ dec = 
              getdseq("H");  
Underscore functions: _spinal(dec); and decprgoff(); or 
             _dseqon(dec); and _dseqoff(dec);   

Htppm:  Module:  yes 
Sequence:  tancpx.c      
Description:  Implements TPPM decoupling on the dec channel during 
              acquisition.  
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aHtppm - amplitude of the dec channel. 
       pwHtppm - approximate 180-degree flip angle on resonance. 
       phHtppm - +/- small angle phase. TPPM is implemented 
              with phases = +/- 1.0 times phHtppm for alternating 
              pulses.  
       chHtppm = 'dec' must be set (not shown).
Implementation: TPPM dec = gettppm("H"); or DSEQ dec = getdseq("H");
