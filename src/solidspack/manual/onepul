Protocol: Onepul  Sequence: onepul.c  Apptype: solidseq1d

Description: 

Single pulse preparation with a choice of SPINAL64 or TPPM 
decoupling direct polarization. Also used for calibration of
the 90-degree pulse width pwX90. 

Setup: 

Load a calibrated data set and select the protocol Onepul. For a 
new nucleus set the desired observe nucleus and array pwX90 to 
obtain a calibration. 

Select the desired decoupling method tppm or spinal. 

If no decoupling is desired select tppm and set aHtppm = 0 or 
set spinal and set aHspinal = 0. If aHtppm = 0 then the decoupler
is turned off and pwHtppm and phHtppm are not used.  Note that 
pwHtppm must be greater than 0.0 even if it is not used. The same 
is true for SPINAL. 

If CW decoupling is desired select tppm and set aHtppm to the 
desired amplitude 0 to 4095 or select spinal and set aHspinal to
the desired amplitude 0 to 4095. Set phHtppm = 0 to set CW decoupling 
and pwHtppm is not used.  The same is true for SPINAL. 

If TPPM decoupling is desired select tppm and set aHtppm to the 
desired amplitude 0 to 4095.  Set pwHtppm to just less than the 
180-degree pulse width for the field strength provided by aHtppm. 
Set phHtppm to about 8.0 degrees.  Array pwHtppm and phHtppm for a 
fine calibration.  Choose the narrowest line with the greatest 
amplitude. Glycine is a good standard for TPPM calibration. 

If SPINAL decoupling is desired select spinal and set aHspinal to
the desired amplitude 0 to 4095.  Set pwHspinal to just less than
the 180-degree pulse width for the field strength provided by 
aHspinal. Set phHspinal to about 12.0 degrees.  Array pwHspinal 
and phHspinal for a fine calibration.  Choose the narrowest line
with the greatest amplitude.  Glycine is a good standard for 
SPINAL calibration.

Parameter Groups:

90X:  Module:  no
Sequence:  onepul.c    
Description:  Provides a 90-degree pulse on obs that can be used 
              as a preparation pulse. Also used to store the obs 
              calibration.
Parameters:  Channels Page
      aX90  - the amplitude of the pulse.
      pwX90 - the pulse length.

Hseq:  Module:  yes 
Sequence:  tancpx.c      
Description:  Chooses SPINAL or TPPM decoupling on the dec channel
              during acquisition.  
Parameters:   Sequence Page - Hspinal and Htppm groups overlap. 
      Hseq - chooses the decoupling sequence, TPPM or SPINAL. 
Implementation:  DSEQ dec = getdseq("H");  The router implements 
              getspinal() or gettppm(). 
Underscore functions: _dseqon(dec); runs _tppm(); or _spinal();
              _dseqoff(dec); runs decprgoff();  

Hspinal:  Module:  yes 
Sequence:  tancpx.c  
Description:  Implements SPINAL decoupling on the dec channel during 
              acquisition.  
Parameters:  Sequence Page
      aHspinal  - amplitude of the dec channel. 
      pwHspinal - approximate 180-degree flip angle on resonance. 
      phHspinal - +/- small angle phase. SPINAL64 is implemented 
                with phases = +/- 1.0, +/- 1.5 and +/-2.0 times phHspinal. 
      chHspinal = 'dec' - must be set (not shown).
Implementation: SPINAL dec = getspinal("H"); or DSEQ dec = 
              getdseq("H");  
Underscore functions: _spinal(dec); and decprgoff(); or _dseqon(dec);
              and _dseqoff(dec);   

Htppm:  Module:  yes 
Sequence:  tancpx.c      
Description:  Implements TPPM decoupling on the dec channel during 
              acquisition.  
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aHtppm  - amplitude of the dec channel. 
       pwHtppm - approximate 180-degree flip angle on resonance. 
       phHtppm - +/- small angle phase. TPPM is implemented 
               with phases = +/- 1.0 times phHtppm for alternating pulses.
       chHtppm = 'dec' - must be set (not shown).
Implementation: TPPM dec = gettppm("H"); or DSEQ dec = getdseq("H");
