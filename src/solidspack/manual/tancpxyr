Protocol: Tancpxyr  Sequence: tancpxyr.c  Apptype: solidseq1d

Description:

Constant, linear or tangent-ramped cross polarization (CP) to X and Y with 
observe on X and Y with a choice of SPINAL64 or TPPM decoupling.

Requires a second receiver on channel 3. RECXY - X = obs, Y = dec,
H = dec2, with observe on obs and dec.  obs must use channels 1 or 2
and dec must use channel 3.

The Polarity mode for rampY is fixed as 'du' and tYramp is set to tHX

Parameter  Groups:

90H:  Module:  no
Sequence:  tancpxyr.c 
Description:  Provides a 90-degree pulse on dec2 that can be used
              as a preparation pulse. 
Parameters:  Channels Page
       aH90  - the amplitude of the pulse.
       pwH90 - the pulse length.

cpHX:  Module:  yes
Sequence:  tancpxyr.c
Description:  Implements constant, linear or tangent-ramped cross
              polarization from dec2 to obs.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       shHX - 'c', constant, 'l', linear and 't', tangent shape on
               the channel designated with chHX.
       chHX - the variable-amplitude channel, 'fr' from or 'to', to.
       aHhx - median amplitude of the dec2 channel.
       aXhx - median amplitude of the obs channel.
       bHX -  +/- tangent curvature (>0 to 1.0e5).
       dHX -  amplitude width of the ramp. A negative width sets a
              ramp that starts high and decreases in amplitude.
       tHX -  contact time
       ofHX - overall offset on the variable channel
       frHX = 'dec2' -  channel with the initial polarization (must
              be set - not shown).
       toHX = 'obs' -  channel with the final polarization (must be
              set - not shown).
Implementation:  CP hx = getcp("HX",0.0,0.0,0,1);
Underscore functions: _cp_(hx, phHhx, phXhx);

rampY:  Module:  yes
Sequence:  tancpxyr.c
Description:  Implements a constant, linear or tangent ramp on the
              dec channel with four polarity modes (uu, ud du (n) and dd).
	      Used to add a third channel to CP.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       shYramp - 'c', constant, 'l', linear and 't', tangent shape on
              the channel designated with chYramp.
       chHramp = 'dec' must be set (not shown).
       pYramp - polarity of ramp (normal 'n' down-up), 'uu' (up-up),
              'ud'(up-down), 'du'(down-up) and 'dd'(down-down).
       aYramp - median amplitude of the dec2 channel.
       bYramp - tangent curvature (>0 to 1.0e5).
       dYramp - +/- amplitude width of the ramp. A negative width sets
              a ramp that starts high and decreases in amplitude.
       tYramp - ramp time
       ofYramp - overall offset on the ramp.
Implementation: RAMP y = getramp("rampY",0.0,0.0,0,1);
Underscore functions: _ramp(y, phYramp);  phYramp is the overall phase 
              table.

Hseq:  Module:  yes
Sequence:  tancpxr.c
Description:  Chooses SPINAL or TPPM decoupling on the dec2 channel
              during acquisition.
Parameters:  Sequence Page - Hspinal and Htppm groups overlap.
       Hseq - chooses the decoupling sequence, TPPM or SPINAL.
Implementation:  DSEQ dec2 = getdseq("H");  The router implements
              getspinal() or gettppm().
