Protocol: Onepultoss  Sequence: Onepultoss.c  Apptype: solidseq1d

Description: 

4-pulse TOSS side-band suppression is applied to X after single-pulse 
excitation, with a choice of SPINAL64 or TPPM decoupling.  Used to 
obtain sideband-free spectra. 

Setup: 
    
Load a calibrated data set and select the protocol Onepultoss. For a 
new nucleus calibrate with Onepul and then select Onepultoss.  

Select the desired decoupling method, TPPM or SPINAL. The manual file 
onepul describes calibration of decoupling. 

Be sure the MAS Rate on the Acquisition page is set correctly. 

Set aXtoss = aX90 and pwXtoss = 2.0*pwX90. 

Fine-calibrate aXtoss and the offset tof to minimize all sidebands. 
   
Parameter Groups: 

90X:  Module:  no
Sequence:  onepul.c    
Description:  Provides a 90-degree pulse on obs that can be used as a 
              preparation pulse. Also used to store the obs calibration.
Parameters:  Channels Page
      aX90  - the amplitude of the pulse.
      pwX90 - the pulse length.

tossX:  Module:  yes
Sequence:  tancpxtoss.c  
Description: Implements four-pulse TOSS sideband suppression on obs. 
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aXtoss - amplitude of the obs pulses. 
       pwXtoss - 180-degree flip on obs.
       chXtoss = 'obs' must be set (not shown).  
Implementation:  WMPA toss = gettoss("tossX");
Underscore function: _toss(toss,phXtoss);  phXtoss is the overall phase 
              table. 

Hseq:  Module:  yes 
Sequence:  tancpx.c      
Description: Chooses SPINAL or TPPM decoupling on the dec channel 
             during acquisition.
Parameters:  Sequence Page - the Hspinal and Htppm groups overlap. 
       Hseq - chooses the decoupling sequence, TPPM or SPINAL. 
Implementation:  DSEQ dec = getdseq("H");  The router implements 
             getspinal() or gettppm(). 
Underscore functions: _dseqon(dec); runs _tppm(); or _spinal();
             _dseqoff(dec); runs decprgoff();  

Hspinal:  Module:  yes 
Sequence:  tancpx.c  
Description:  Implements SPINAL decoupling on the dec channel during 
              acquisition.  
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aHspinal - amplitude of the dec channel. 
       pwHspinal - approximate 180-degree flip angle on resonance. 
       phHspinal - +/- small angle phase. SPINAL64 is implemented with 
              phases = +/- 1.0, +/- 1.5 and +/-2.0 times phHspinal. 
       chHspinal = 'dec' must be set (not shown).
Implementation: SPINAL dec = getspinal("H"); or DSEQ dec = 
              getdseq("H");  
Underscore functions: _spinal(dec); and decprgoff(); or _dseqon(dec); 
              and _dseqoff(dec);   

Htppm:  Module:  yes 
Sequence:  tancpx.c      
Description:  Implements TPPM decoupling on the dec channel during 
              acquisition.  
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aHtppm - amplitude of the dec channel. 
       pwHtppm - approximate 180-degree flip angle on resonance. 
       phHtppm - +/- small angle phase. TPPM is implemented 
              with phases = +/- 1.0 times phHtppm for alternating pulses.  
       chHtppm = 'dec' must be set (not shown).
Implementation: TPPM dec = gettppm("H"); or DSEQ dec = getdseq("H");   
Underscore functions: _tppmon(dec); and decprgoff(); or _dseqon(dec); 
              and _dseqoff(dec);
