Protocol: Mrev8  Sequence: mrev8.c  Apptype: solidseq1d

Description: 

   "X" acquisition with interleaved MREV8. Nonquadrature phase cycle. 

Additional Software:
 
reset_mrev8q - This macro uses the calibrated values of pwX90 and aX90 
to calculate the initial parameters for mrev8X.  This macro is run from 
the protocol.

Parameter Groups: 

prepX:  Module:  no 
Sequence:  br24q.c      
Description:  Implements a variable length pulse to provide quadrature 
              detection about a tilted precession axis. Typically followed 
              by a windowed multiple-pulse acquisition.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aXprep - the amplitude of the obs pulses. 
       pwXprep - 90-degree flip on the obs channel. 
       phXprep - small-angle phase offset of the pulse. The phase must 
              be reset to zero after the pulse. 

scaleX:  (processing)  Module:  no 
Sequence:  br24.c    
Description:  Shows the F2 scale factor, scalesw, for evolution of the 
              obs nuclei under a multiple-pulse waveform. 
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       scalesw - the F2 scale factor. Typically scalesw is the inverse 
              of the mutiple-pulse scale factor.      
   
mrev8X: Module:  yes 
Sequence: mrev8.c  
Description:  Implements MREV8 on obs with acquisition in the first 
              window.    
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       aXmrev8 - amplitude of obs pulses.
       pwXmrev8 - 90-degree flip on obs.
       r1Xmrev8 - pre-pulse delay (similar to rof1). 
       r2Xmrev8 - post_pulse delay (similar to rd or rof2).
       r3Xmrev8 - T/R-to-rcvron delay (must equal rof3 or 2.0 us if 
              rof3 is not defined). 
       tauXmrev8 - time for one "one-tau" window and pulse. 
       npaXmrev8 - number of 100 ns ticks in the detection window. 
       chXmrev8 = 'obs' must be set (not shown).
Implementation:  WMPA mrev8 = getmrev8("mrev8X");
Underscore function: _mrev8(mrev8,phXmrev8); phXmrev8 is the overall 
              phase table.
