Protocol: Ineptxytancp  Sequence: ineptxytancp.c  Apptype: solidseq1d

Description:

   CP preparation of "Y" with INEPT transfer to "X" and observe, with
   SPINAL or TPPM decoupling.  Separate SPINAL and TPPM decoupling are
   allowed during INEPT transfer.

Additional Software

   reset_ineptyx - Uses the value of srate to synchronize the delays t1YXinept
   and t2yxinept with the rotor. The macro is executed with the protocol. 

Parameter Groups

90H:  Module:  no
Sequence:  tancpx.c
Description:  Provides a 90-degree pulse on dec that can be used as a
              preparation pulse. Also used to store the dec calibration.
Parameters:  Channels Page
      aH90  - the amplitude of the pulse.
      pwH90 - the pulse length.

cpHY:  Module:  yes
Sequence:  dcptan.c
Description:  Implements constant, linear or tangent-ramped cross
              polarization from dec to dec2.
Parameters:  Sequence Page
       shHY - 'c', constant, 'l', linear and 't', tangent shape on the
              channel designated with
                      chHY.
       chHY - the variable-amplitude channel, 'fr' from or 'to', to.
       aHhy - median amplitude of the dec channel.
       aXhy - median amplitude of the dec2 channel.
       bHY - tangent curvature (>0 to 1.0e5).
       dHY - +/- amplitude width of the ramp. A negative width sets a
              ramp that starts high and decreases in amplitude.
       tHY - contact time.
       ofHY - overall offset on the variable channel.
       frHY = 'dec' - channel with the initial polarization (must be
              set - not shown).   
       toHY = 'dec2' - channel with the final polarization (must be set
              - not shown).
Implementation: CP hy = getcp("HY",0.0,0.0,0,1);
Underscore function: _cp_(hy,phHhx,phYhy); phHhx is the overall phase
              table for the H channel and phYhy is that for the Y channel.

Description:  Implements an INEPT polarization transfer from dec2 t
              obs.

       pw1Yyxinept - 180-degree flip angle on the dec2 channel.
       pw1Xyxinept - 180-degree flip angle on the obs channel.
       pw2Yyxinept - 90-degree flip angle on the dec2 channel.
       pw2Xyxinept - 90-degree flip angle on the obs channel.
       t1YXinept - delay for J-evolution.
       t2YXinept - delay for J-refocusing.
       ch1YXinept = 'dec2' must be set (not shown).
       ch2YXinept = 'obs' must be set (not shown).

Underscore function:_ineptref(inept,ph1Yyxinept,ph1Xyxineptph2Yyxinept
             ,ph2Xyxinept,ph3Yyxinept, ph3Xyxinept); runs INEPT with 
             refocusing. The additional arguments are the phase tables
             of the INEPT pulses as labeled.
