vastglue2 - assemble related 1D datasets into a 2D (or pseudo-2D) dataset.
*******************************************************************************

This macro is used to artificially reconstruct a 2D dataset from a series of 
1D datasets having similar filenames.  It is crucial to ensure that the 
format of the filenames of each of the 1D datasets is identical.

This macro reads in each 1D file, in succession, and adds it to the 
previous data, but in a 2D format.  This macro assumes that 
filenames are of the format obtained when a nondefault setting of 
autoname has used (specifically, vastglue2 assumes that 
autoname='filename_R%RACK:%_Z%ZONE:%_S%SAMPLE#:%_').  
If autoname has not been redefined, use a macro like vastglue 
(see the corresponding manual entry).

The resulting reconstructed 2D dataset will need to be saved in the 
normal manner (using svf).

Arguments:
The default is to glue all the spectra stored in the current directory 
that have the proper filename format (from 1 through arraydim).  An 
optional argument (glue(##)) allows one to specify that only spectra 
from 1 through ## are to be glued.
