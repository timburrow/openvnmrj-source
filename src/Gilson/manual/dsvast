dsvast   -   Display VAST Data in a stacked 1D-NMR matrix format
****************************************************************************

If an array of 1D spectra have been acquired (in particular if a block 
of 96 spectra have been acquired using VAST automation, 
especially in a microtiter-plate format), and if these spectra have 
been glued into a reconstructed 2D dataset (see vastglue),
this macro will arrange and display them (on the screen) in a convenient 
8 x 12 sample format (as a matrix of 1D spectra).

Uses a file (template) created by plate_glue to display a matrix of data.  
The number of spectra displayed, and their order, are controlled by the template file.
Each "little spectrum" is labeled with its respective alphanumeric coordinates.  
The modulo number controls how many spectra appear per row. 
Example:   dsvast(<display order>, <modulo>)
