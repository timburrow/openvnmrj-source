aslmirtime - Calculate ASL multiple IR (MIR) times
==================================================


Installation Instructions
=========================

The routines provided here link against the GNU Scientific Library (GSL).
As such GSL must be installed.

The GNU Scientific Library (GSL)
--------------------------------
The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is not typically bundled with Linux.
The aslmirtime Makefile assumes that the library is installed in either a
standard system location or /usr/local. The library source can be downloaded
from http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl. Those subjected to Windoze can install
Cygwin from http://www.cygwin.com which includes GSL.

aslmirtime
----------
aslmirtime can be built by typing,

  make

or, for debug mode,

  make debug

aslmirtime can be installed using the command,

  make install

or, for Windoze,

  make winstall

The default installation directory is ~/bin which is created if it does not
exist.

Configurations on which aslmirtime is known to compile cleanly include:
x86_64 RedHat Enterprise Linux 5 with gcc 4.1.2
i686 Cygwin with gcc 4.3.4
