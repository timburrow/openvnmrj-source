To build the console software, the makemi script must be executed on a Sun computer.
The wind, windppc2, and windt202ppc directories are needed.
These currently are on "moon", a sun computer, at /export/home/dji/sunbuild
Root password for moon is gindari1. Execute the makemi script as biopack on moon.
The wind* directories are also on mccoy at /usr42/vj22d/vj22c_dvd
See the makemi script to see the env parameters that must be set.
The makemi script needs access to a git-repo. I currently use sw2 (148.5.173.63).
at /home/vnmr1/vjbuild/git-repo. The moon currently does
mount sw2:/home /sw2
Make sure the git-repo on sw2 is up to date.
At the bottom of the makemi script, the compiled programs are
copied back into the git repository.
Comment those lines to avoid this step.
I typically tar the inova and mercury "console" directories and move the tar
file to a place where I have git.
