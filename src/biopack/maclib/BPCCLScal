"TWO formats for calibrating flipbacks:"
">>>ONE:"
"BPCCLScal3('WTG','both',phincr0,p3,p3_phase,p4,p4_phase,pwHs,pwHs_phase,shape,autocal,tpwrs)"
"WTG: watergate type of scheme"
"i.e. flipback is immediately preceding or following a hard pulse"
"water magnetization is along +/- Z before the 1st pulse (hard or flipback)"

">>>TWO:"
"BPCCLScal3('INEPT','both',phincr0,p1,p1_phase,p2_phase,p3_phase,p4,p4_phase,gt,gzlvl,gstab,pwHs,pwHs_phase,shape,autocal,tpwrs)"
"INEPT: INEPT type of scheme"
"i.e. flipback is immediately following a train of pulses that involves an echo"
"on water magnetization, with gradient dephasing and rephasing, followed by a recovery delay"

"in both cases, set second argument to 'both' or 'tpwrsf' for calibrating both phase and power 
"or only power (for 180 flipback pulses)"
