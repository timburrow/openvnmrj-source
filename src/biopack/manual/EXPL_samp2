Data Processing of Explicit Sampling Data
****************************************

The parameters of spectrum should be set:

	numerical resolutions (fn, fn1, fn2)

	parameters of weighting (sin/cos: sb, sbs, sb1, 
	sbs1, sb2, sbs2; exp: lb, lb1, lb2; if weighting is not desired – 
	deactivate the weighting by unchecking the checkboxes). For now
	only sinebell/cosinebell and exponential weighting is supported.
	No weighting should be used when exponential "e" or gaussian "g"
	distribution are used. 
	
	reference frequencies: reffrq, reffrq1, reffrq2. 
	It is important to have a proper reffrq when upper and lower F3 
	limits are activated (F3start, F3end). The macro "setref"
	sets reffrq properly and it is run as part of the setup macro.

F1F3 diff is difference between centers of F3 (1H) and 
F1 (1H) dimensions which might be necessary in 3D 13C/15N edited 
NOESY measurements.

All the parameters entered in the panel will be automatically saved 
in the procpar file, before starting of processing. There are two 
spectra file formats available: Sparky program format (the file with
the ".ucsf" extension) and NMRDraw program format (the set of files
with the ".ft3" extension ). The required format should be chosen
before starting the transformation. In both cases the output files are 
stored in the same folder as FID and procpar (curexp/acqfil/).

The button “MFT!” starts the transformation. The MFT Program 
could also be started directly from a shell, then it should be called
with parameters:
	name of folder with the FID
	name of file with the timetable
	output file format (0: Sparky, 1: NMRDraw)
	begining of direct dimension range
	end of direct dimension range 
We recommend processing on a data station rather than spectrometer
host if speed is an issue.

The "MFT!" button also copies the sampling schedule specified
in the Sampling Schedule entry box into the file
curexp+'/acqfil' to save the copy of the schedule used for the
MFT processing.
Do not re-create a new sampling schedule until the FID is saved,
so that the FID file will contain the sampling schedule 
used for the data collection.

The file out.txt contains a log of program activity.

Additional programs (for example cleaning artefacts and program
starting MFT from NMRPipe dataset after FT of directly detected dimension)
will be available from nmr700.chem.uw.edu.pl
