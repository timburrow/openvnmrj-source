  Changed from original code from Mayo's group by Mike
  Osborne, March 2006 for compatibility with Biopack

  array gzlvl2 for diffusion decay
  can include homospoil X-gradient to improve water (gzlvl3)
  tpwrsf_u and tpwrsf_d allow fine power control of soft pulses
  phincr1 allows phase shifting of first watergate pulse

   
  It has been seen that better (more accurate) results are obtained if no decoupling
  is used for unfolded proteins.
