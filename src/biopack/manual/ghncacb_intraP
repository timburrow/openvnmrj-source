  ghncacb_intraP

    3D iHNCACB gradient sensitivity enhanced version.

This pulse sequence records an intraresidue 1H(i)-15N(i)-13CaCb(i)
correlation spectrum ( non-TROSY or TROSY).

Set 13C carrier (dof) at 174ppm.
Set dm2='nnn' dm='nnn'

Set jnca-20-24, jnco=15, jhn=95-105 and jcoca=53-65.
Note that by setting jnca=20, the sequential connectivities
 can be completely suppressed.

Shapes are automatically created by Pbox. All pulse powers and
pulse widths on 13C are automatically calculated.

Sequence revised by Perttu Permi Sept 2006:
   (submitted as gi2hn_cacbP_pp.c)

 Bloch-Siegert compensation is accomplished in a manner similar to
 other standard Biopack sequences i.e. using a single 180(13CO) pulse
 and adding a small angle phase shift to 90 degree 13Ca (13CaCb) pulse.

 There are two major differences between ihn_evol and hn_evol in bionmr.h:

 i)  the 15N shift is decremented --> f2coef='1 0 -1 0 0 1 0 1'
 ii) 90 degree 13CO and 13Ca pulses are applied in addition to 13C
     180 pulses during back-transfer, whereas in hn_evol only 180 pulses
     are applied.
