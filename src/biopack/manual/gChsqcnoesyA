    3D C13 edited noesy with separation via the carbon of the destination site
         recorded on a water sample 

    NOTE: cnoesy_3c_sed_pfg(1).c 3D C13 edited NOESYs with separation via the
          carbon of the origination site. (D2O experiments)

    Uses three channels:
         1)  1H             - carrier @ water  
         2) 13C             - carrier @ 35 ppm 
         3) 15N             - carrier @ 118 ppm

    Set dm = 'nny', [13C decoupling during acquisition].
    Set dm2 = 'nny', [15N decoupling during acquisition].

    Must set phase = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI
    acquisition in t1 [H]  and t2 [C].

    Set f1180 = 'y' and f2180 = 'y' for (90,-180) in F1 and (90,-180) in F2.
    c180_flg='y' for HH 2D (ni) experiment (fixed d3 (t2) in this case) 
    c180_flg='n' for carbonyl decoupling using wfg during t2 (3D only)
    Note: Zero order phase correct may not be exactly +90 in F2 due to seduce.

    Modified by L. E. Kay to allow for simult N, C acq   July 19, 1993
    original code: noesyc_pfg_h2o_NC_dps.c
    Modified for dps and magic angle gradients D.Mattiello, Varian, 6/8/94
    Modified for vnmr5.2 (new power statements, use status control in t1)
      GG. Palo Alto  16jan96
    Modified to use only z-gradients and only C13 editing (use wCNnoesy for
     simultaneous editing of N15 and C13
    Modified to permit magic-angle gradients
    Modified to use BioPack-style of C=O decoupling
     
    STUD DECOUPLING.   SET STUD='y':
       Setting the flag STUD='y' overrides the decoupling parameters listed in
       dg2 and applies STUD+ decoupling instead.  In consequence is is easy
       to swap between the decoupling scheme you have been using to STUD+ for
       an easy comparison.  The STUD+ waveforms are calculated for your field
       strength at the time of BioPack installation and RF power is 
       calculated within the pulse sequence.  The calculations are for the most 
       peaks being greater than 90% of ideal. If you wish to compare different 
       decoupling schemes, the power level used for STUD+ can be obtained from 
       dps - subtract 3dB from that level to compare to decoupling schemes at
       a continuous RF level such as GARP.  The value of 90% has
       been set to limit sample heating as much as possible.  If you wish to 
       change STUD parameters, for example to increase the quality of decoupling
       (and RF heating) change the 95% level for the centerband
       by changing the relevant number in the macro makeSTUDpp and 
       rerun the macro (don't use 100% !!).  (At the time of writing STUD has
       been coded to use the coarse attenuator, because the fine attenuator
       is not presently included in the fail-safe calculation of decoupling 
       power which aborts an experiment if the power is too high - this may
       lower STUD efficiency a little).
