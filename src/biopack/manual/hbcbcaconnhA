  hbcbcaconnh_3c_pfg1_sel_500a.c - auto-calibrated version of the original sequence

    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiment:

    3D cbcaconnh (enhanced sensitivity PFG and with minimal perturbation of
       water) correlating cb(i),ca(i) with n(i+1), nh(i+1).

                      F1       C_beta (i), C_alpha (i)
                      F2       N (i+1)
                      F3(acq)  NH (i+1)

    Uses three channels:
    1)  1H             - carrier (tof) @ 4.7ppm [H2O]
    2) 13C             - carrier (dof @ 58ppm [CA] and dofcacb @ 43ppm [CA,CB])
                                 (Note: centre of F1 is 43ppm (dofcacb))
    3) 15N             - carrier (dof2)@ 119ppm [centre of amide N]  


    Set dm = 'nnn', dmm = 'ccc' 
    Set dm2 = 'nny', dmm2 = 'ccp' [15N decoupling during acquisition]
                      dseq2 = 'waltz16' 

    Must set phase = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI
    acquisition in t1 [carbon]  and t2 [N]. [The fids must be manipulated
    (add/subtract) with 'grad_sort_nd' program (or equivalent) before regular
    processing.]

    Flags
         fsat     'y' for presaturation of H2O
         fscuba   'y' to apply scuba pulse after presaturation of H2O
         f1180    'y' to get 180deg linear phase correction in F1,
                      otherwise linear phase correction is 0.
         f2180    'y' to get 180deg linear phase correction in F2,
                      otherwise linear phase correction is 0.

    Standard Settings: fsat='n', fscuba='n', f1180='n', f2180='n'.
    
    The flag f1180/f2180 should be set to 'y' if t1 is 
    to be started at halfdwell time. This will give -90, 180
    phasing in f1/f2. If it is set to 'n' the phasing will
    be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.
    Set f1180 to n for (0,0) in C and f2180 = n for (0,0) in N

    Modified by L.E.K 11/24/92 to include enhanced pfg and shaped C' pulses
    Modified by L.E.K. 01/03/93 to reduce phase cycle by adding gradients
             in the t1 evolution constant time domain. H decoupling now
             begins in the interval immediately following the t1 evolution
             domain.   
    Modified by G.G 10/14/93 to permit DPS and remove gate
    Modified by L. E. K May 25, 94 to minimize water saturation 

    Modified by L. E. Kay, Nov 2, 95 to ensure adequate delays between
         power statements and pulses (especially for Innova).

    Modified by L.E.Kay, Nov 24, 95 to include a complete exocycle on
         the N15 180 pulse in the center of the t2 evoln period. Can
         still use a 4 step cycle - 8 is preferred. 
    
    Added a user adjustable phase shift (sphase1) for one of the
    off-resonance CO 180b pulses - RM Mar 11, 1998.
