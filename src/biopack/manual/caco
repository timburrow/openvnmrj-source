    2D 13C observe CACO experiment with IPAP option. 
    IPAP='i' for inphase splitting and IPAP='a' for anti-phase splitting.


    Set tn='C13', dn='H1', dn2='N15, dn3='H2'.

    
    Offsets:
    
    CO          = 174ppm    13C carrier position
    CAB		= 44.2 ppm    shifted for CACB pulses
    CA		= 57.7ppm   shifted for CA pulses
    N15         = 120ppm
    H1          = 4.7ppm
