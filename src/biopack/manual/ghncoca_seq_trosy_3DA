  ghncoca_seq_trosy_3DA.c - auto-calibrated version of the original sequence
 
    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiment:

    3D hncoca (Hn,N,Ca) (enhanced sensitivity PFG) with deuterium decoupling
                        F1       C_alpha     (i-1)
                        F2       N  + JNH/2  (i)
                        F3(acq)  NH - JNH/2  (i)

    This sequence is designed for highly deuterated samples and makes use
     of TROSY principles to enhance sensitivity in N and HN dimensions.

    This sequence uses the standard four channel configuration
         1)  1H             - carrier @ 4.7 ppm [H2O]
         2) 13C             - carrier @ 56 ppm (CA)
         3) 15N             - carrier @ 120 ppm  
	 4)  2H		    - carrier @ 4.5 ppm  

    Standard flag setting
	CT_flg = 'y'  for constant time Ca chemical shift evol. period
	c180_flg = 'n' for Ca chemical shift refocussing (only when CT_flg='n')
	f1180 = 'n'  for (0,0) phase correction in f1
	f2180 = 'n'  for (0,0) phase correction in f2
	fsat = 'n' fscuba = 'n'. don't saturate water
        sel_flg = 'y' for active suppression of the fast relaxing component
                  'n' for relaxation suppression of the fast relaxing
                      component 
	dm = 'nnn'
	dm2 = 'nnn' dmm2 = 'ccc' [NO 15N decoupling during acquisition]
	dm3 = 'nnn' dmm3 = 'ccc'
	
    Must set phase = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI
    acquisition in t1 [Ca]  and t2 [N]. [The fids must be manipulated (add/
    subtract) with 'grad_sort_nd' program (or equivalent) before regular
    processing with non-VNMR processing software]
    
    This scheme uses TROSY principle in 15N and NH with transfer of
    magnetization achieved using the enhanced sensitivity pfg approach,

    If sel_flg =='n' then the component of interest is not actively
    selected for; relaxation will attenuate the undesired component.
    Selection is achieved during the first N---> 13C' transfer.

    In general it is very difficult to present rules indicating when
    sel_flg should be set to y or n. In the case of applications at
    750 or 800 MHz and for correlation times in excess of 20 ns the
    sel_flg can be set to no and selection via relaxation should suffice.

    At lower field or for smaller molecules set sel_flg == 'y', for
    example at 500 or 600 MHz and for correlation times between 15 and 25ns
    set sel_flg=='y'. We have used sel_flg=='n' for a molecule with a
    correlation time of 43 ns and not observed any residual signal from
    the undesired component.

  Setup:  delta is the difference in Hz between C' and Ca 
   At a:  carbon carrier on C' (174ppm).
      b:  carbon carrier on Ca (56 ppm).
          pwco90a:  C' 90 at delta/sq(15), on res.
          pwco180a: C' 180 (seduce), on res.
          pwca180a: Ca 180 at delta/sq(3), off res.
          pwca90b:  Ca 90 at delta/sq(15), on res.
          pwca180b: reburp 180, at 45 ppm. 
          pwco180b: C' 180 (seduce), off res. --> if CT_flg==y
                    C' 180 at delta/sq(3), off res. --> if CT_flg==n
          shared_CT: set to y to extend N15 acq. time
     

   Modified by L.E.Kay on March 3, 1999 to insert C' 90 purge after 15N
    evolution to ensure in case where the N-C' refocussing is not complete
    (2*bigTN < 1/2JNC') that the remaining NxCz' magnetization which
    becomes NHxCz' is not present. This will remove a dispersive contribution
    to the F3 lineshape 

   Modified by L.E.Kay on Nov. 22 2001 to include shared CT in the 15N dimension (F2)

   Modified by L.E.Kay to include a nietl_flg to suppress the anti-trosy component
     in an active manner with no sensitivity loss
