 tnroesy - rotating frame NOE experiment with T-Roesy modification 
              allows T-Roesy or standard cw Roesy

             OBSERVE TRANSMITTER SHOULD BE SET AT SOLVENT POSITION
             SATURATION,SPIN LOCK AND PULSES ALL USE OBS.XMTR

        p1 = 90 degree pulse on protons (power level at "p1lvl")
        pw = 90 degree spin lock pulse at tpwr (active only if T_flg='y')
     p1lvl = power level for the p1 pulse
      tpwr = power level for the spin lock pulse(s)
     T_flg= 'y' gives pulsed T-Roesy; 'n': cw Roesy
     phase = 1,2: F1 quadrature by the hypercomplex method
       mix = mixing time
     sspul = 'y': activates gradient-90degree-gradient pulse prior to d1
   satmode = activates transmitter presat at satfrq 
             (satfrq = tof; satmode='nnn' or satmode='ynn')
    satdly = length of saturation during relaxation delay  
    satpwr = power level for solvent saturation
        nt = min:  multiple of 4; max:  multiple of 8

   mfsat='y'
           Multi-frequency saturation. 
           Requires the frequency list mfpresat.ll in current experiment
           Pbox creates (saturation) shape "mfpresat.DEC"

                  use mfll('new') to initialize/clear the line list
                  use mfll to read the current cursor position into
                  the mfpresat.ll line list that is created in the
                  current experiment. 

           Note: copying pars or fids (mp or mf) from one exp to another does not copy
                 mfpresat.ll!
           Note: the line list is limited to 128 frequencies !
