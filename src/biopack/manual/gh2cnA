    This pulse sequence will allow one to correlate HE, CE, NZ for Lys,
          H(epsilon) -> C(epsilon) -> N(zeta) for Lysine
    and HD, CD, NE for Arg
          H(delta)   -> C(delta)   -> N(epsilon) for Arginine

    (in addition the Asn HB, CB, ND and Gln HG, CG, NE can be observed
     and possibilities for CO decoupling are available
     comp180 for simultaneous decoupling of aliphatic and carbonyl C)

    Region-selective and shaped pulses are internally calculated by
    simple power/pulse width expressions for on-resonance pulses, and
    by Pbox for frequency-shifted pulses.

    This sequence uses the standard three channel configuration
         1)  1H             - carrier (tof) @ H2O [4.77 ppm]
         2) 13C             - carrier (dof) @ CD/CE [42 ppm]
         3) 15N             - carrier (dof2) @ center of NE/NZ [76 ppm]
                            - carrier (dof2) @ LYS [33 ppm]
    
    Set dm = 'nny', dmm = 'ccp' 
    Set dm2 = 'nnn'

    Must set phase = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI acquisition in t1 and t2
    
    
    Flags
        fsat            'y' for presaturation of H2O
        fscuba          'y' for apply scuba pulse after presaturation of H2O
        f1180           'y' for 180 deg linear phase correction in F1 (15N)
        f2180           'y' for 180 deg linear phase correction in F2 (13CA)
			'n' for phases (0,0) which also gives perfect baseline
        ch_plane            to avoid 15N evolution when recording 2D CH plane

	Standard Settings
        fsat='n',fscuba='n',f1180='y',f2180='n'

		Magnetization go through N instead of Co
		Changed phases like in paper but in order of importance 
		Constant time CA evolution

		remain closer to Ottiger & Bax sequence;
		waltz16 throughout the sequence, adjusted CT CA evolution period

        Improvements by fm, 03 May 2004
                added ch_plane flag for zero 15N evolution time when
                  recording HC plane
                added waltz 1H decoupling during 15N evolution

                set taub=1/4J (1.8 ms) to obtain
                100% transfer efficiency for CH2 (Hz -> Cx + 4CxHzHz)

	31 May 2007; implemented in Groningen on 600
		     put back to normal z gradients from xgrad version
