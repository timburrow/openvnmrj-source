    Kay's TROSY implemented by PZ 4/8/04 (not tested!!)
    sel_flg         'y' for active suppression of the anti-TROSY component
    sel_flg         'n' for relaxation suppression of the anti-TROSY component
    gzlvl1 and gzlvl2 are coherence selection gradient and need to optimized emperically

    Tested on HCAII, for nt=128,
                     s/n=41 for active  suppresion
                     s/n=48 for passive suppresion
