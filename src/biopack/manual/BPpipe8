     Process This Data Set by NMRpipe
**********************************************
The checkboxes at the left determine how NMRpipe 
processes the data.

"Display Data with NMRdraw"
NMRpipe processes the data and will produce
displays via NMRdraw. If this option is not 
selected the NMRpipe-processed data will be
used to create VnmrJ-format data. Normal VJ
commands and parameters are used to display
and plot the data.

"Use Only Displayed Region"
Many experiments result in data only in one
region (e.g., NH-edited experiments). To speed
processing and reduce space needed for processed
data, NMRpipe will produce data that show only the
region selected in the display before processing
is initiated.

"Nuclei for t1,t2,t3..."
This value sets the parameter "dimension".

Enter nuclei in order of detection nucleus,
nucleus evolving in t1, nucleus evolving in t2,
etc. For example, in HNCO dimension='C13 N15 H1'
(do not use the format '13C 15N 1H').
BioPack sequences are written for 1H on the observe
channel, 13C on the first decoupling channel and
15N on the second decoupling channel.

"Select Experiment Type (*D)"
Set a value to specify the generic experiment
(e.g., "HNCA" rather than "ghn_ca" or "ghn_caCT").
This sets the parameter BPpipetype that is used
for selecting labels in NMRdraw displays.

"Manual Mode"
This menu permits the user to select a specific mode
of operation, usually manual operation.

The "Process the Data in This Experiment" button is
used to begin the processing.
