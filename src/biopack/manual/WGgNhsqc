  WGgNhsqc.c

    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiment:

    WATERGATE HSQC for N15 with options for refocussing during t1 and
    editing spectral regions.

        	  CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

    Set dm = 'nny', dmm = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for C13 decoupling.
    Set dm2 = 'nny', dmm2 = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for N15 decoupling.

    Must set phase = 1,2  for States-TPPI acquisition in t1 [N15].
    
    The flag f1180 should be set to 'y' if t1 is to be started at halfdwell
    time. This will give -90, 180 phasing in f1. If it is set to 'n' the 
    phasing should be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.  Thus,
    set f1180='n' for (0,0) in N15.  f1180='y' is ignored if ni=0.


          	  DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF WGgNhsqc

         
    1. Obtain a printout of the Philosopy behind the BioPack development,
       and General Instructions using the macro: 
                                      "printon man('BioPack') printoff".
       These Detailed Instructions for WGgNhsqc may be printed using:
                                      "printon man('WGgNhsqc') printoff".
             
    2. Apply the setup macro "WGgNhsqc".  This loads the relevant parameter set
       and also sets ni=0 and phase=1 ready for a 1D spectral check.

    3. Centre H1 frequency on H2O (4.7ppm), C13 frequency on 110ppm, and N15 
       frequency on the amide region (120 ppm).

    4. CHOICE of t1 decoupling:
       H1refoc='y' and C13refoc='y' decouples H1 and C13 during t1.
       H1refoc='n' and C13refoc='y' decouples only C13 during t1.
       H1refoc='n' and C13refoc='n' does no decoupling during t1.

    7. WATERGATE:
       flipback='y' adds selective flipback H2O sinc one-lobe pulse.
       The WATERGATE employs low power square pulses.
       Water suppresssion may be improved by varying the finepwrf
       level. Theoretically, it should be ~2048. Vary +-10% to find 
       best result, as indicated by minimal H2O signal.
