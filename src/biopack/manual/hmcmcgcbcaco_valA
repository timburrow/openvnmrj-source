  hmcmcgcbcaco_valA.c

    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following
    experiment:

    3D CT transfer from Cm to Cb to Ca to co for Val 
       Use for deuterated samples
	  	F1     13CO 
               	F2     13Cm
               	F3(acq) 1Hm

    Uses three channels:
    For proteins:
         1)  1H             - carrier @ 4.7 ppm [H2O]
         2) 13C             - carrier @ 94 ppm 


    Set dm = 'nny', dmm = 'ccp' [13C decoupling during acquisition].
    Set dm2 = 'nnn', dmm2 = 'ccc' 

    Must set phase = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI
    acquisition in t1 [H]  and t2 [C].

    Set f1180 = 'y' and f2180 = 'n' for (0,0) in F1 and F2.    

    Sit at 40 ppm, then jump to 176 then back to 40 ppm

      shp_reb   = reb_on.RF  (300 us)
      shp_rebco = reb_136p.RF (300 us)
