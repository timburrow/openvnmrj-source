 gNhsqcHT.c    Hadamard version of the Fast N15 HSQC using 3919 watergate 

    Requires a frequency list of N-15 resonances, htfrq1 in the current 
    experiment. The list is generated by recording a gNhsqc spectrum, 
    and manual peak picking using the editht macro to initialize the 
    htfrq1 parameter in the current experiment  

    parameters:
    ==========
    htbw1 - excitation bandwidth. For pshape = 'gaus180' good numbers are 
          90, 45, 30 or 20 Hz.
    ni  - number of increments. Must be a power of 2. Other allowed values 
          are n*12, n*20 and n*28, where n is a power of 2.
    nimax - sets limit to ni to prevent unrealistic experiments.
    htofs1 - ni offset. Sets the number of increments to be omitted. Typical
            value is niofs = 1.
    pshape - shape used for Hadamard encoding, typically gaus180, square180,
             sinc180.
    bscor - Bloch-Siegert correction for Hadamard encoding, typically set 
            bscor = 'y'.
    repflg - set repflg = 'n' to suppress Pbox reports.
    ssF1 - stepsize for Hadamard encoding pulses. This parameter is adjusted
           by looking at the maximum phase increments in Hadamard enconing
           pulses, e.g. F1_2.RF. If unsure, set ssF1 = 0 to disable it.
    Hdseq - name of NH decoupling (.RF) pulse. Use inversion pulses of 1 - 1.5 ms and
           an appropriate supercycle. The total length must be the same as  
           that of the Hadamard encoding pulse (F1_1.RF). For example, 
           with 45 ms long pulse (htbw1=20 Hz) use a 40 step supercycle (e.g.             
           t5,m8) and a 1.125 ms long adiabatic pulse:
           >Pbox NHdec -w "wurst2i 25k/1.125m" -sucyc t5,m8 -s 5.0 -p ... -l ...   
           the _htbw1 macro creates the shape automatically
    Hdpwr - Power level for pwpat (NH decoupling).            
    Cdseq - name of CN decoupling (.RF) pulse. Only active if C13refoc = 'y'.
           Use inversion pulses of duration less than 1/5J(CN) (ca 5-10 ms) 
           and an appropriate supercycle. The total length must be the same   
           as that of the Hadamard encoding pulse (F1_1.RF). For example, 
           with 45 ms long pulse (bw1=20 Hz) use a 8 step supercycle (e.g.             
           t5,m8) and a 5.625 ms long adiabatic pulse:
           >Pbox CNdec -w "wurst2i 50k/5.625m" -sucyc m8 -s 3.0 -p ... -l ...   
           the _htbw1 macro creates the shape automatically
    Hdpwr - Power level for pwpat (NH decoupling).
