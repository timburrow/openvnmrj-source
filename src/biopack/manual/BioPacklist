UPDATING the PROBEFILE
***********************

UPDATE parameters with values appropriate for your spectrometer, then click
the "Update Probefile with Parameter Values in this Parameter Set" button in 
the "Globals&Probefile" page in the Setup folder, or ENTER "BPbiopack2".

FIRST TIME
***********
When BioPack is activated, reasonable values of sw/tof/dof/dof2 are set. 
If no particularl knowledge is avaliable for your spectrometer, leave
these values unchanged. 

POWER LIMITS
************
In ANY case in which power limits are desired, activate BioPack Power 
Limits in the Globals&Probefile page of the Setup Folder (VnmrJ), then  
click on the "BioPack Power Limits" checkbox. The BioPack 
power limit entry boxes then can be filled in. 

Set desired values for 
BPtpwrmax/BPdpwrmax/BPdpwr2max/BPdpwr3max/BPdpwrspinlock
as maximum powers (consult probe manual for typical values). Alternatively,
disable these limits and after a full AutoCalibration, examine the power in
wurst140.DEC in shapelib. This is a useful upper limit for 13C decoupling. The
15N decoupling power limit can be set by adding 2dB to the power set in the
probe file after the AutoCalibration. 

BPspinlock is the user-defined "normal" CC spinlock field (in Hz,typ. value 
is 7000 at 600 MHz). These BP* parameters are global parameters created at
BioPack install and are used by the "BPcheck*" macros & in 
update/BPsvp/BPrtppar macros.

ACQUISITION
***********
sw           desired sw for normal spectrum (use at least 14ppm)
sw1(sw2)     desired Carbonyl(Nitrogen) spectral width,~ 20*dfrq (40*dfrq2)
ni,ni2       set=1
phase,phase2 set=1
at           desired acquisition time (usually 0.050-0.075 seconds)
d1,temp      desired relaxation delay/temperature
gain         desired "normal" gain for triple resonance/ hsqc experiments
spin         set to 'n' and turn off spinner (in acqi)
rof2,alfa    set to values which result in lp=0 for 1D acquisition (typ. 2usec
             for rof2 and 4usec for rof2 with dsp='r'. For a cold probe use
             an rof2>25usec.)
BPpwrlimits  set=1 for power limits to be active
waltzB1      set to the number of Hz for 1H decoupling when needed (typ. 8ppm)

CHANNEL 2
*********

            This value is set automatically by the BPbiopack2 macro.
pwClvl,pwC  carbon "hardpulse" power level and corresponding pw90 (ch2)
            (consult probe manual for maximum pwClvl when using CRYOGENIC probe)
compC       (C13pw90 at pwClvl-6)/(2.0*C13pw90 at pwClvl)
BPdpwrmax  maximum power when using power limits
BPspinlock  This (global)value will be used for the spinlock field strength (Hz) for 
            parameter sets using a CC-Tocsy element (*hcch_tocsy*,g*c_co_nh*).
            Defaults:7000 at 600 MHz, 6000 Hz at 500 MHz, 5000 at 400 MHz. 
            Care should be given for 750/800/900 MHz, the bandwidth 
            may have to be reduced to protect the probe/sample.
CHANNEL 3
*********
pwNlvl,pwN  nitrogen "hardpulse" power level and corresponding pw90 (ch3)
compN       (N15pw90 at pwNlvl-6)/(2.0*N15pw90 at pwNlvl)

DEUTERIUM DECOUPLING   
********************
 Channel 4 not Present:     
  set dm3='nnn' dn3='' dpwr3=0 dmf3=0 
  dof3 is set automatically by the BPbiopack2 macro to 4ppm

  Refer to BioPack.dir/BioPack.README for details on 2H calibrations. Automatic     
  calibration is available by button in the "Calibrations" page in the Setup
  folder (VnmrJ). In VnmrJ there is a manual page available by clicking a 
  button describing the process.
  
 (enter dm3='nyn' dg2 to view parameter values. Update them and set dm3='nnn')

  dn3         set = 'H2'
  dpwr3       normal 2H broadband decoupling power (during evolution)
  dm3         set to 'nnn' (later,set to 'nyn' for any sequence but ghn_co for
              2H decoupling during pulse sequence-not during acquisition) 
  dmf3        normal dmf3 corresponding to dpwr3
  dseq3/dres3 set ='', 1.0

GRADIENTS
*********
mag_flg     'y' for magic-angle coherence transfer gradients(triax probe)
gzcal       set at 0.0020 for probes with 65G/cm output ,0.0010 for others)
            (check gcal value (stored in global) for last calibrated value,
             or at_gzcal (AutoTest-derived) in your ~/vnmrsys/global)
For mag_flg='n' (z-axis or triax probes - pfgon='nny'or 'yyy'):
gt1         Gradient time (typically ~1-3msec)
gzlvl1      set at 13000-25000 (probes with 65G/cm output)
gzlvl2      =gzlvl1
            (these values may be varied for a better trade-off of water
             suppression vs. diffusion losses)

For mag_flg='y' (to use magic-angle gradients with triax probes - pfgon='yyy'):
gzlvl1      set <= 10000 (probes with 65G/cm output )
gzlvl2      set <= 9700 (probes with 65G/cm output )
             autocalibration sets gzlvl2 for maximum in NH-detected sequences
 (Check value of gzlvl2 with and without magic-angle for optimum.)

Set ddrtc=rof2+alfa as inital value
