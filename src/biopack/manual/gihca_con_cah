 gihca_con_cah

 Uses coherence selection and (optional) magic angle gradient pulses.

 3D gihca_con_cah  correlates Ha(i), CO(i-1) and N(i).
 Ref: Mäntylahti et al., J. Biomol. NMR, 49, 99-109 (2011).

    Uses three channels:
         1)  1H   (t3)       - carrier  4.7 ppm (tof)
         2) 13CO  (t1, ni)   - carrier  174 ppm  
            13Ca             - carrier  174 ppm (dof) 
         3) 15N   (t2, ni2)  - carrier  120 ppm (dof2) 

    Setting the delay bigTNCa to ~25 ms provides null 
    for Ha(i-1), CO(i-1), N(i) cross peaks, whereas both pathways
    (with opposite phases!) can be selected by setting 
    bigTNCa=bigTNC ~15ms.

    gzcal = gcal for z gradient (gauss/dac),   
    mag_flg = y,  using magic angle pulsed field gradient
                   uses gzcal (= 0.0022 gauss/dac, for example)   
             =n,  using z-axis gradient only


    The waltz16 field strength is enterable (waltzB1).
    Typical values would be ~6-8ppm, (3500-5000 Hz at 600 MHz).
