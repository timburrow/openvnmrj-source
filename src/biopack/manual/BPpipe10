     Process Multiple Data Sets in Exps 
**********************************************
 When this option is selected BPpipenexp different entry
boxes are displayed. Time-domain data sets to be processed 
should be present in Exps specified by the numbers in these
boxes prior to using the NMRpipe processing. If VnmrJ display
and/or processing parameters present in these Experiments are
to be used, the appropriate checkboxes at the left should be
set. Otherwise, default NMRpipe processing will be used.

The results of the NMRpipe processing will be placed in these
Experiment files so that VnmrJ can be used to display and/or
plot the data. NMRpipe processing scripts and files used for
each of the Experiments are stored in Experiment files. If
these are to be preserved, the button "Save Pipe Files" should
be used to place the NMRpipe processing scripts and files into
the .fid files used for each Experiment (this implies that the
data files were originally saved by the macro BPsvf).

NMRpipe processing is initiated by the "Process These
(Muliple) Data Sets" button, using the options selected
at the left (except the Export function). For appropriate
data sets, strip plots can be generated automatically
using the "Process These Data Sets and Make Strip Plots"
button.

Any of the processed data sets may be viewed by joining the
desired experiment. In this case, normal VnmrJ commands and
panels would be used to display the NMRpipe-processed data.
NMRpipe-processed data.
