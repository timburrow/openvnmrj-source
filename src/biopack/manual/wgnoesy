   wgnoesy  -  NOESY experiment with water suppression by gradient echo.  
               No attempt is made to suppress J-cross peaks in this pulse 
               sequence. F1 axial peaks are shifted by States TPPI method. 
 
               Phase of flipback pulse is currently only optimal for the case of radiation 
               damping during mix, so set flipback='n' for enhancing 
               water exchange crosspeaks.  
 
               Buffer line(s) suppression is available via a WET pulse during the mix period. 
               For this, set wet='y' and create shape using Pbox to do selective 90 degree  
               pulse on buffer line(s). The 1H xmtr will remain at the H2O position so create 
               the shape with an ofs value of the distance to the H2O from the buffer line(s). 
               The wet pulse width must be less than ~1/4 of the mix time. The watergate 
               portion of the pulse sequence does the water suppression. 
                
               cor permits correction of delay for proper lp=0. Try small values (0-10usec)
               on first increment spectra and choose cor value for getting lp=0. 
 
               C13refoc flag for C13 decoupling in t1. 
               15N refocussing done if N15refoc='y' 
               Both 13C and 15N refocussing done if CNrefoc='y'  
               Dropped power 3db down for both N15 and 13C if simulaneous 180's. 
 
               Uses composite C13 180s in t1 
 
               Limited bandwidth of C13 180s in t1 favors aliphatic-only or aromatic-only
