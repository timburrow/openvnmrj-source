 CN4Dnoesy_trosyA

      This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiment:
       4D 13C 15N edited noesy, with TROSY detection in F3,F4. 

        F1,F2 are 15N dimensions, F3,F4 are 1H dimensions

      Set C_flg to y to eliminate evolution during t2 (during the running of some test 2D sets
       before the 4D.

      Place dof at 18 ppm in 13C. The adiabatic pulse must be centered at 117 ppm.
