  Parameters:

        pw = 90 degree excitation pulse on the observe transmitter
        pwx1 = 90 degree excitation pulse on first decoupler
        pwx2 = 90 degree excitation pulse on second decoupler
        pwx3 = 90 degree exc        pulse    third  dec
      jC13 = J(C13-H1) coupling constant
      jN15 = J(N15-H1) coupling constant
      jP31 = J(P31-H1) coupling constant
      jname identifies the nucleus of interest

For 2H pw90 determination, vary pwx3 from 0 to 400usec (or so) at an appropriate
dpwr3 (for example, 46). Use C6D6 with direct C13 observe using the triple-
resonance probe (use 2H reject filter at input of BB preamp). Connect BB preamp
through this filter to the C13 port of the probe. Connect channel 4 amplifier
output to 2H Decoupling Accessory (coupler box). Disconnect lock cable from probe
and connect to coupler box. Connect new cable from coupler box to the lock BNC
of the probe.

Select pwx3 value for which the outer satellites of the C6D6 triplet go through
a null. On a 600 triple-resonance probe this happens at about 200usec at a
dpwr3 of 46.

Broadband 2H decoupling,even using waltz16, does not require this much power-even
at 600 MHz. For testing, use the ddec_s2pul parameter set. Enter a dpwr3 value
12 dB lower than used above and multiply the pw90 by 4. Then enter dmf3=1e6/pw90,
e.g. dmf3=1e6/800. This sets the proper power level and dmf for broadband 
decoupling using any of the status-controlled dmm values, e.g. 'cwc' or 'cgc'.
