 PR42_gChsqcnoesyChsqc

This pulse sequences is used for PR4D methyl-NOE experiments.
Note that the HMQC-NOE-HMQC approach is superior for aliphatic NOEs.
For methyl NOEs, the narrow distribution of carbon chemical shifts makes it less
of an issue for multiple pulses.

Uses three channels:
    1)  1H             - carrier @ water  
    3) 15N             - carrier @ 118 ppm
    2) 13C             - carrier @ 35 ppm
