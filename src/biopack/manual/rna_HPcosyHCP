   pwPlvl - X pulse power level
   pwP    - X 90 deg pulse
   hdpwr  - proton BB decoupling (during d1 using obs channel) power 
   hdres  - tip-angle resolution for the hdshape
   hd90   - 90 pulse width at hdpwr for BB decoupling
   hdshape - decoupling modulation shape
   hdflg - 'y' for decoupling
           'n' no decoupling
   phase - 1,2 (only hypercomplex with FAD is supported)
   sspul - HS-pw90-HS before d1


   Use with D2O-sample!!
