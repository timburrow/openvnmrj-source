/*  rna_WGgNhsqc.c

    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiment:

    WATERGATE HSQC for N15 with options for refocussing during t1 and
    editing spectral regions.


                      NOTE dof MUST BE SET AT 110ppm ALWAYS
                      NOTE dof2 MUST BE SET AT 200ppm ALWAYS


    pulse sequence: 	Sklenar V., JMR, A102, 241 (1993)


        	  CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

    Set dm = 'nny', dmm = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for C13 decoupling.
    Set dm2 = 'nny', dmm2 = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for N15 decoupling.

    Must set phase = 1,2  for States-TPPI acquisition in t1 [N15].
    
    The flag f1180 should be set to 'y' if t1 is to be started at halfdwell
    time. This will give -90, 180 phasing in f1. If it is set to 'n' the 
    phasing should be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.  Thus,
    set f1180='n' for (0,0) in N15.  f1180='y' is ignored if ni=0.


          	  DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF rna_WGgNhsqc

         
    1. Obtain a printout of the Philosopy behind the RnaPack development,
       and General Instructions using the macro: 
                                      "printon man('RnaPack') printoff".
       These Detailed Instructions for rna_WGgNhsqc may be printed using:
                                      "printon man('rna_WGgNhsqc') printoff".
             
    2. Apply the setup macro "rna_WGgNhsqc".  This loads the relevant parameter set
       and also sets ni=0 and phase=1 ready for a 1D spectral check of Nimino.

    3. Apply the setup macro "rna_WGgNhsqclr".  This loads the relevant parameter set
       and also sets ni=0 and phase=1 ready for a 1D spectral check of Naromatic.

    4. Centre H1 frequency on H2O (4.7ppm), C13 frequency on 110ppm, and N15 
       frequency on the aromatic N region (200 ppm).

    5. CHOICE OF N15 REGION:
       amino='y' gives a spectrum of amino resonances centered on dof=85ppm.
       This is a common usage.                               Set sw1 to 40ppm.

       imino='y' gives a spectrum of imino groups.  dof is shifted
       automatically by the pulse sequence code to 155ppm.  Set sw1 to 25ppm.

       In both cases set sw=22ppm and JNH=95Hz.

       Naro='y' gives a spectrum of Naromatic (N1/N3 and N7/N9) resonances
       centered on dof=200ppm.				Set sw1 to 90ppm.
       Use JNH=22Hz (actucal value 10-14Hz).

    6. CHOICE of t1 decoupling:
       nondect1='n' and C13refoc='y' decouples H1 and C13 during t1.
       nondect1='y' and C13refoc='y' decouples only C13 during t1.
       nondect1='n' and C13refoc='n' does no decoupling during t1.

    7. WATERGATE:
       flipback='y' adds selective flipback H2O sinc one-lobe pulse.
       The WATERGATE employs low power square pulses.
       Vary finepwrf around the value of 2048 to optimized suppression
