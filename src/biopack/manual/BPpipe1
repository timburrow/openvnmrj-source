        Use Default Parameters
**********************************************

Summary:

This checkbox sets the parameter BPpipeautoproc='y'.

When any "Process" button is used, NMRpipe will
set default processing parameters for weighting,
linear prediction and solvent filtering. Phasing
will be determined by NMRpipe.

Results of the processing will be copied to
the current experiment and normal VnmrJ commands,
and panel operations are used to display and
plot the data. Saving the fid after this operation
will also save the NMRpipe scripts and files used
to process the data.

This mode is used for users who do not manually
set weighting functions, transform sizes, linear
prediction, solvent filtering and phasing in each
dimension.
