EXPLICIT SAMPLING 

The processing of conventional multidimensional NMR spectra 
is based on series of one dimensional Fourier Transforms. 
This approach requires time domain points lying on Cartesian 
grid. This limitation could be omitted by application of the 
Multidimensional Fourier Transform. The most important 
feature of MFT is ability to have processing time domain data 
points of any distribution.

The conventional programming of multidimensional pulse 
sequences relies on implicitly incremented evolution delays 
(i.e. d2, d3, d4). For the ith-dimension the increments of 
1/(swi) are calculated automatically and added in consecutive 
steps of time domain sampling. Therefore, the user controls the 
experiment by specifying number of increments in each 
dimension (ni, ni2, ni3). 

The maximum evolution time might be evaluated as 
(number of increments -1)/spectral width, while the total 
number of data points in the indirectly sampled time domains 
equals the product of numbers of increments (i.e. ni*ni2*ni3).

Since the MFT could be performed using any sampling scheme 
it enables one to choose time coordinates for each time 
domain point and acquire data in any order. The time domain 
points coordinates are listed explicitly in the text file, 
the numbers are normalized to [0,1] range. 

Note that this approach allows one for planning any sampling 
pattern, from conventional, radial (used in Projection 
Reconstruction techniques), spiral etc., to random distributions. 
Any sampling pattern stored in the file is possible without 
the need of changing pulse sequence code. 

The macro "BP_ESset" should be executed first. It could be 
entered from command line or by selecting Explicit Sampling
in the "Select Sampling" menu in "Digital Filter" page.  

It creates all required parameters and produces the pulse
sequence(if necessary). It may rarely happen that the sequence 
does not convert successfully. In such case see the file manual/ 
EXPL_samp_seq.

The total number of acquired points is controlled only by ni 
(note that ni2, and ni3 should be set to 1). The textfile path 
name containing time domain points coordinates must be specified 
in the string parameter timetab_name, eg. timetab_name= 
userdir+'/tablib/EStablename’. The same file is 
necessary for proper Multidimensional FT processing. The 
general rule is to set the smallest possible nt (to accomplish 
the basic phase cycle) and ni the highest possible for the given 
experimental time.

Real time, rather that constant time evolution should be used. 
(e.g. for 13C) and semi-constant time (available in 
many experiments for 15N) instead of constant time.

How to create a time table file:
********************************

The time table file should be set in the entry box in
the "Digital Filter" page. Using the same name of the
output file will result in the existing file
being overwritten. The number of points 
(ni) should be entered and the sampling type should be chosen.  
For most types there are some extra parameters. Available types 
of sampling are:

radial (points on a few lines) – parameters: phi_0 (angle of 
       first line), d_phi (angular step), n_phi (number of lines)

spiral (points on two spirals, clockwise and anticlockwise) 
      – parameter: n_rounds (number of rounds of each spiral)

random (uniform distribution in both dimensions) – no 
       additional parameters

gauss (gaussian distribution in both dimensions, with maximum in 
      t=0) – parameter: sigma (the probability is proportional 
      to exp(-t^2/(2sigma^2))

exp   (exponential distribution in both dimensions) – 
      parameter: sigma (rate of decay, the probability is 
      proportional to exp(-t/sigma))

g-r   (uniform in first dimension and gaussian in second 
      one) – parameter: sigma (for the first dimension)

e-r   (uniform in first dimension and exponential in second 
       one) – parameter: sigma (for the first dimension)

For random, gaussian and exponential type of sampling
it is recommended to use the option of optimizng
the points distribution (see J Magn Reson 188: 344-356 (2007)),
by activating the "opt" check box.

All tables are created using maximum times equal to 1, the 
sigma parameter should be adjusted to this value. Of course, a 
table of any set of points can be also created outside VnmrJ, 
but then maximum times should also be 1.

The button "Create Schedule" creates the sampling schedule using
the specified "ni" and sampling method (and any associated 
parameters) under the name and location specified by the
Sampling Schedule File entry box.

The button "View Schedule" displays a plot of time domain data 
points. It requires installed gnuplot.

The button "Relative points density" allows for calculating
the ratio of current density (ni/t1max/t2max) to Nyquist density
(1/sw1/sw2). It is realiable to perform the experiments with
the density smaller then 1.

Starting the experiment.
************************

The maximum evolution times should be set by parameters t1max 
and t2max. These should be set in view of the natural decay times.
They are not related to ni/sw1 or ni2/sw2 as in normal sampling,
but are used to set the evolution times within the t1/t2 
distribution. 

In order to enable quadrature detection the array parameter 
should be left as in conventional experiment, i.e array=’phase,phase2’  
for three dimensional experiments. Thus, in a 3D experiment four fids 
are acquired for each time domain point. The phase variables should 
be set identically to those in conventional experiments, allowing for 
echo-antiecho selection or switching between sine- and cosine-modulated 
spectra in the States method. 

The f2coef 3D parameter should be present in the procpar file. It
describes the way of getting frequency signs (quadrature) 
in the last indirectly detected dimension, and depends on the 
actual pulse sequence. Standard BioPack sequences have f1coef and
f2coef set properly by default.
 
For example: 

f2coef = ‘1 0 -1 0 0 -1 0 -1’ for echo-antiecho or 
f2coef = ‘1 0 0 0 0 0 -1 0’ for States method. 

The current version of MFT processing module so far supports only 
one phase modulation (echo-antiecho) – in the last indirectly 
detected dimension. Quadrature in other dimensions, i.e. F1 in 3D,
is assumed to be accomplished by the States technique. 

We advise first acquiring 2D spectra for 0/90 deg. projection 
(i.e. F1F3 and F2F3 planes in the 3D case) using the conventional 
sequence. The data should be transformed, referenced and phased
with the same parameters determining phases. 

Then, if desired, copy the parameter
set to a different "exp" and select "Explicit Sampling" from the
menu in the "Digital Filter" page in the "Acquire" folder. The
values of rp,lp for directly detected dimension and rp1,lp1,rp2,lp2 
are then present in procpar file and are used in MFT processing.

The experiment is begun by using the "Begin Experiment" button. This
does an ordinary "go" as well as copying the time domain points
file (the full path is visible in the Sample Schedule File entry box).
This latter function is not necessary for collection of the data, but
it ensures that a copy of the relevant evolution time values is kept
unchanged until the next "go" in the current experiment.

If the resulting FID is stored by the BioPack BPsvf macro, the time 
domain points file is stored together with fid.
