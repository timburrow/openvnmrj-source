Description of BioPack Options in "Lock" Page


Gradient Shimming Buttons:
**********************

"Setup Gradient Shimming"
 This button runs "gmapsys" to permit making shimmaps.

"Gradient Autoshim on Z"
 This button runs gradient shimming using the current
 shimmap.

Lock Control, Lock Display and Activate Lock Checkbox:
*****************************************************

Standard lock controls

Entry Boxes:
***********

These set global parameters useful for searching the database
with the "Locator". When a data file is saved, these parameter
values are also saved in the *.fid file.

Auto Fid save:
**************

When this checkbox is checked, the autofidsave name is displayed
and can be altered.

Time-Domain Noise Measurement:
*****************************

The "Empty Probe" button starts a process that:
1. Saves the current parameter set as a temporary .par file
   in the current experiment, e.g. exp5.
2. Sets seqfil='s2pul', pw=0, p1=0, d2=0 and makes sure
   there is no array.
3. Runs an acquisition to produce a time-domain fid under
   standard condtions (gain=50, sw=100000, nt=1, at=2).
4. This fid has no signal, but lots of zero-crossings with
   large noise amplitude. The "noise" command is run to
   quantify the time-domain RMS noise. This result is
   stored in a local variable "empty_noise" and (if autotest
   has been run in the user account) an AutoTest "history"
   file is started or added to. In addition, the value is
   stored in the probefile. This value is then displayed as
   a "textmessage" in the Lock page.
5. The temporary parameter set is now retrieved, restoring
   all the conditions.

The "Sample in Probe" button starts a process that:
1. is similar to the "Empty Probe" button, except that a
   different AutoTest file
   different AutoTest file is produced. The "sample_noise" value 
   is also displayed in the Lock page. The value is not stored
   in the probe file because this is a sample property
   and not a probe property. The value however,
   along with the "empty_noise" value, is stored in
   the current parameter set and will be saved in
   the "procpar" of the saved data. This permits the user
   or administrator to view these values at any later time
   as a aid in diagnosing performance.

The ratio of sample-to-empty noise is displayed

The AutoTest history files can then be viewed at any
time to monitor performance. The are names "NOISE...."
with the observe nucleus noted in the name. AutoTest
will have to have been run earlier for these files to
be created.

Naturally, by the time you remember to use the "Empty
Probe" button, the sample is in the probe! However, all
you have to do is to use the "Eject Sample" button on the
toolbar. The sample will rise to the top of the upper barrel 
and you can still click on the "Empty Probe" button, 
producing the above process. (Just remember to use the
"Insert Sample" button before continuing!).

This procedure can be automated so that every (non-arrayed) 
experiment will have the sample noise
measured. This is done by the BPgo macro which is used
by the "Acquisition Acqtions" menu on the toolbar. The
"Globals&Probefile" page in the "Setup" Folder now has a
checkbox for "Do Automatic FID Noise Check at go" (this
sets a global parameter). If this parameter is 'y', BPgo will
first do a sample noise measurement as above and then
the desired experiment. Since this measurement is
something that is not experiment-specific, it is normally 
done when the sample is first put into the probe and 1D 
spectra are acquired.
