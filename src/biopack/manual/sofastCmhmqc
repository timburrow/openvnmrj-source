    constant-time evolution    (CT_flg)
    homonuclear 13C decoupling (Cdecflg,Cdecseq)

 Note: decoupling of carbons attached to methyls
 can induce Bloch-Siegert shifts. These can be
 somewhat compensated for by placing an identical
 decoupling band upfield from the observed methyl
 carbon region at the same distance away in Hz.
 Observed 13C methyl shifts will be displaced from
 the true shift by the magnitude of the BS shift
 and this can be significant if too high a power
 or bandwidth is used for the decoupling in 
 evolution.

 Decoupling can also perturb the methyl evolution
 if the bandwidth of the decoupling is too large.
 Some carbons coupled to methyl carbons have shifts
 close to the methyl carbon region so these may not
 be possible to decouple.

 The setup macro creates Pbox waveforms, including 
 the decoupling waveform used in evolution. The
 Pbox parameter values can be changed for enhancing
 specific performance.
