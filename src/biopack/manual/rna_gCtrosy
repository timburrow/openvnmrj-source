    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiment:

    TROSY with gradients for C13/H1 chemical shift correlation with optional
    N15 refocusing and editing spectral regions.


                      NOTE dof MUST BE SET AT 110ppm ALWAYS
                      NOTE dof2 MUST BE SET AT 200ppm ALWAYS


    S3 option: [S3='y']:
    pulse sequence:     Meissner and Sorensen, JMR, 139, 439-442 (1999)
    TROSY method only applied for carbon nuclei. Need to decouple during
    aquisition.

    S3 option: [S3='n']:
    pulse sequence:     according to Weigelt, JACS, 120, 10778 (1998)
    TROSY method applied for carbon and proton nuclei. No decoupling during
    aquisition.

    Both sequences are using coherence gradients and the Sensitivity Enhancement
    train for better H2O suppression for CH resonances very close to H2O.

    The sequence will function correctly with ribose='y'/aromatic='y'/allC='y'.
    Although, the TROSY enhancement will only be achieved for aromatic nuclei.

    VNMR processing (wft2da):
    f1coef = '1 0 -1 0 0 -1 0 -1' for nonCT
    f1coef = '1 0 -1 0 0 1 0 1' for CT

    THE CT OPTION: [CT='y']:
    This converts the t1 C13 shift evolution to Constant Time and is the recommended
    usage for S3='y' and S3='n'.
    The constant time delay, CTdelay(1/Jcc), can be set for optimum S/N for any type
    of groups, eg 28ms for ribose and 14ms for aromatics. For the allC option
    it is best to set the CTdelay to 1/Jcc(ribose) which equals 2/Jcc(aromatic).
    Note that in some options, CTdelays less than 8ms will generate an error
    message resulting from a negative delay.


                  CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

    Set dm = 'nny', dmm = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for 13C decoupling.
    Set dm2 = 'nny', dmm2 = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for 15N decoupling.

    Must set phase = 1,2  for States-TPPI acquisition in t1 [C13].

    The flag f1180 should be set to 'y' if t1 is to be started at halfdwell
    time. This will give -90, 180 phasing in f1. If it is set to 'n' the
    phasing should be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.  Thus,
    set f1180='n' for (0,0) in C13.  f1180='y' is ignored if ni=0.


                  DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF rna_gCtrosy


    1. Obtain a printout of the Philosopy behind the RnaPack development,
       and General Instructions using the macro:
                                      "printon man('RnaPack') printoff".
       These Detailed Instructions for rna_gCtrosy may be printed using:
                                      "printon man('rna_gCtrosy') printoff".

    2. Apply the setup macro "rna_gCtrosy".  This loads the relevant parameter set
       and also sets ni=0 and phase=1 ready for a 1D spectral check.

    3. Centre H1 frequency on H2O (4.7ppm), N15 frequency on the aromatic N
       region (200 ppm), and C13 frequency on 110ppm.

    4. CHOICE OF C13 REGION:
       ribose='y' gives a spectrum of ribose/C5 resonances centered on dof=85ppm.
       This is a common usage.                               Set sw1 to 60ppm.

       aromatic='y' gives a spectrum of aromatic C2/C6/C8 groups.  dof is shifted
       automatically by the pulse sequence code to 145ppm.  Set sw1 to 30ppm.

       allC='y' gives a spectrum of ribose and aromatic resonances. dof is
       set by the code to 110ppm.                        Set sw1 to 110ppm.

    5. N15 COUPLING:
       Splitting of resonances in the C13 dimension by N15 coupling in N15
       enriched samples is removed by setting N15refoc='y'.  No N15 RF is
       delivered in the pulse sequence if N15refoc='n'.  N15 parameters are
       listed in dg2.

    6. 1/4J DELAY TIMES:
       These are listed in dg/dg2 for possible change by the user. JCH is used
       to calculate the 1/4J time (lambda=0.94*1/4J) for H1 CH coupling evolution,
       tCH is the 1/4J time for C13 CH coupling evolution.
       Lambda is calculated a little lower (0.94) than the theoretical time to
       minimise relaxation, but tCH should be as close
       to the theoretical time as possible.  So for:
         ribose CH/CH2:           JCH=145Hz         tCH = 0.00172
         aromatic CH:             JCH=180Hz         tCH = 0.00139
         allC:                    JCH=160Hz         tCH = 0.00156

    7. Wet option: (wet='y'):
       For optimum H2O-suppression use wet='y'.

    8. TROSY peak selection (bottom and right option if S3='n'):

       Type trace='f1' for display of 2D spectrum
       with bottom='y' and right='y' the bottom-right peak of the coupled
       2D gets selected
       with bottom='y' and right='n' the bottom-left peak of the coupled
       2D gets selected
       etc.
