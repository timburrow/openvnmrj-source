 hadamac

This sequence should be able to separate gly,ser,asn/asp,cys/aromatic,ala and thr.
Thr appears for free in a separate subspectrum due to its high Cb-Cg coupling. 
When setting tauC3 (Cb->Ca & Cb->Cg) to 16ms, they appears mostly negative.
tauC1 (Cb->Ca transfer) can be optimized to the JCBCA value without being bothered
by the Ca remaining from the first block. 

Using the Hadamard steps defined as belove, the bands have the following signs:


had_flg		Thr	Gly	Ser	Ala	Asn/Asp		Rest(Cys/aro)
1		+	+	+	+	+		+
2		+	+	-	-	-		+
3		-	+	+	+	-		+
4		-	+	-	-	+		+
5		-	-	+	-	+		+
6		-	-	-	+	-		+
7		+	-	+	-	-		+	
8		+	-	-	+	+		+

epsilon value should be between 4 and 6ms.

NOTE: The parameter "had_flg" is a string parameter. Therefore, arraying this 
parameter should be done as had_flg='1','2','3',...., NOT had_flg=1,2,3,...
