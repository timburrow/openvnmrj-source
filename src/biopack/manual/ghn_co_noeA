  ghn_co_noeA.c

 DESCRIPTION and INSTRUCTION:

    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiment:
    3D CO-edited NOE-H(N)CO which correlates  HN-NOE with CO(i-1). 
    ni(t1)  ---> 1H
    ni2(t2) ---> 13CO

    REFERENCE:
    Weixing Zhang, Thomas E Smithgall and William H Gmeiner, JMR, B111, 305-309 (1996)	

    OFFSET POSITION:
        tof =   ~4.75 ppm (1H on water).
        dof =   174 ppm (13C on CO).
        dof2 =  120 ppm (15N region).

    CHOICE OF FLAGS:
    mag_flg = y --> Using magic angle gradients (Triax PFG probe is required).
    wgate == 'y'--> Using 3-9-19 watergate for water suppresion.
    wgate == 'n'--> Using gradient selection for water suppression.
    (for non-vnmr processing, gradsort should not be used since there is no 15N evolution.)
     
    flipback:  first character 'y' for primary flipback pulse
               second character 'y' for flipback within watergate 
 
    Modified the amplitude of the flipback pulse(s) (pwHs) to permit user adjustment
    around theoretical value (tpwrs). If tpwrsf < 4095.0 the value of tpwrs is increased 
    6db and values of tpwrsf of 2048 or so should give equivalent amplitude. In cases of 
    severe radiation damping( which happens during pwHs) the needed flip angle may be 
    much less than 90 degrees, so tpwrsf should be lowered to a value to minimize the 
    observed H2O signal in single-scan experiments (with ssfilter='n').(GG jan01)

    The autocal and checkofs flags are generated automatically in Pbox_bio.h
    If these flags do not exist in the parameter set, they are automatically 
    set to 'y' - yes. In order to change their default values, create the flag(s) 
    in your parameter set and change them as required. 
    The available options for the checkofs flag are: 'y' (yes) and 'n' (no). 
    The offset (tof, dof, dof2 and dof3) checks can be switched off individually 
    by setting the corresponding argument to zero (0.0).
    For the autocal flag the available options are: 'y' (yes - by default), 
    'q' (quiet mode - suppress Pbox output), 'r' (read from file, no new shapes 
    are created), 's' (semi-automatic mode - allows access to user defined 
    parameters) and 'n' (no - use full manual setup, equivalent to the original code).

   FOR DETAILS OF PARAMETERS AND SEQUENCE SEE  ghn_co.c and gnoesyNhsqc.c
     NOTE: TROSY is not implemented for this sequence.

    The waltz16 field strength is enterable (waltzB1).
    Typical values would be ~6-8ppm, (3500-5000 Hz at 600 MHz).
