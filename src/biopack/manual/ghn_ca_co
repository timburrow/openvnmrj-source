    3D HN(CA)CO gradient sensitivity enhanced version.


    Correlates CO(i) with N(i), NH(i) via 11Hz N-Ca coupling, and with N(i-1),
    NH(i-1) via -7Hz N-Ca coupling.  Uses constant time evolution for the
    15N shifts.

    Standard features include square pulses on Ca with first null at 13CO; one
    lobe sinc pulses on 13CO with first null at Ca; shaka6 composite 180 pulse
    to simultaneously refocus CO and invert Ca; one lobe sinc pulse to put H2O
    back along z (the sinc one-lobe is significantly more selective than
    gaussian, square, or seduce 90 pulses); optional 2H decoupling when Ca 
    magnetization is transverse for 4 channel spectrometers.  

    Magic-angle option for coherence transfer gradients.  TROSY option for
    N15/H1 evolution/detection.

        	  CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

    	Set dm = 'nnn', dmm = 'ccc' 
    	Set dm2 = 'nny', dmm2 = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for 15N decoupling.
	Set dm3 = 'nnn' for no 2H decoupling, or
		  'nyn'  and dmm3 = 'cwc' for 2H decoupling.

    Must set phase = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI acquisition in
    t1 [13C]  and t2 [15N].
    
    The flag f1180/f2180 should be set to 'y' if t1/t2 is to be started at
    halfdwell time. This will give 90, -180 phasing in f1/f2. If it is set to
    'n' the phasing should be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.  Thus,
    set f1180='n' for (0,0) in 13C and f2180='n' for (0,0) in 15N.  f1180='y' is
    ignored if ni=0, and f2180='y' is ignored if ni2=0.



          	  DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF ghn_ca_co


    1. Obtain a printout of the Philosopy behind the BioPack development,
       and General Instructions using the macro: 
                                      "printon man('BioPack') printoff".
       These Detailed Instructions for ghn_ca_co may be printed using:
                                      "printon man('ghn_ca_co') printoff".

    2. Apply the setup macro "ghn_ca_co". This loads the relevant parameter set
       and also sets ni=ni2=0 and phase=phase2=1 ready for a 1D spectral check.
       At the middle of the t1 period, the 180 degree pulses on Ca and 15N are
       swapped to a 180 degree pulse on CO, for the first increment of t1, to
       refocus CO chemical-shift evolution ensuring a zero first-order phase
       correction in F1. This is also the case for the 1D spectral check, or
       for 2D/15N spectra, when ni=0.

    3. Centre H1 frequency on H2O (4.7ppm), C13 frequency on 56ppm, and N15 
       frequency on the amide region (120 ppm).  The C13 frequency is shifted to
       the CO region during the sequence, but phase coherence is not required 
       after each shift.

    4. The normal 13C 180 degree pulse on Ca at the middle of t1 induces a
       phase shift, which should be field-invariant, and so this phase shift has
       been calibrated and compensated in the pulse sequence. This phase shift
       can be checked by setting ni=1 whereby a special 1D method is invoked
       in which both the 13C Ca 180 degree pulse and the simultaneous 15N 180
       degree pulse are applied just as for all t1 times other than t1=0.  First
       eliminate the Ca pulse by setting pwC3=0 and obtain a 1D spectrum. This
       spectrum will have reduced intensity compared to ni=0 because of 13CO
       chemical-shift evolution during the time of the 180 pulses. If the
       phase shift is adequately compensated, a second very similar 1D spectrum
       will be obtained with pwC3=pwC3a.  As described in more detail for  
       ghn_co, a more sensitive comparison of the two spectra with pwC3=0,pwC3a 
       can be obtained with phase=2.  If not adequately compensated, the
       first increment will be out of phase with all succeeding increments and a
       zero-order phase-shift will be necessary in F1, which is easily done
       after the 2D/3D transform. Alternatively, change the calibration by
       changing the phshift3 parameter in the INITIALIZE VARIABLES section of
       the code. The pulse pwC3 is automatically reset to its calibrated value
       (=pwC2) within the pulse sequence code for 3D work and 2D/t1 studies.
       DO NOT CHANGE pwC2 from its calibrated value.  dof can also be 
       calibrated using ni=1;pwC3=pwC3a as described for ghn_co, and S/N
       can also be maximized using a compC array when ni=1;pwC3=pwC3a.

    5. H2O preservation is achieved according to Kay et al, except that a sinc
       one-lobe selective pulse is used to put H2O back along z.  This is much
       more selective than a hard, Seduce1, or gaussian pulse.  WALTZ
       1H decoupling is only on during the timeTN periods.

    6. Another difference from the work of Kay et al is that the phases of the
       first and last CO 90 degree pulses are alternated to eliminate artifacts
       from the Ca 180 degree pulse.

    7. tauC (3.7 ms) and timeTN (13.5 ms) were determined for alphalytic 
       protease and are listed in dg2 for possible readjustment by the user.

    8. TROSY:
       Set TROSY='y' and dm2='nnn' for a TROSY spectrum of the bottom right
       peak of the 2D coupled NH quartet (high-field H1, low-field N15).  The 
       TROSY spectrum gives 50% S/N compared to the decoupled spectrum for a 
       small peptide.  To select any of the other three peaks of the 2D coupled
       quartet, in a clockwise direction from bottom right, change t4/t10
       from x/y to x/-y to -x/-y to -x/y.  NOTE, the phases of the SE train
       are almost the same as those determined for the gNhsqc sequence.  The
       major difference is that kappa is eliminated compared to normal
       ghn_co_ca so the N15 magnetization has not evolved with respect to the 
       attached H's.  I.e. the N15 state would be Ix rather than IySz if there 
       was no coherence gradient - this imparts a 90 degree shift so t8 is 
       changed to y (from x in the normal spectrum).  Also gzlvl1 is after the
       180 N15 pulse rather than before as in gNhsqc, so the sign of icosel 
       and the t4/t10 phase2 increments are also swapped compared to gNhsqc.
       For ghn_c... type sequences, H1 decoupling during the first timeTN is
       replaced by a pi pulse at kappa/2 to reduce S/N loss for large molecules
       during the first TN period.  For these sequences H2O flipback is 
       achieved with two sinc one-lobe pulses, one just before
       the SE train, similar to gNhsqc.
       
    9. PROJECTION-RECONSTRUCTION experiments:  
       Projection-Reconstruction experiments are enabled by setting the projection 
       angle, pra to values between 0 and 90 degrees (0 < pra < 90). Note, that for 
       these experiments axis='ph', ni>1, ni2=0, phase=1,2 and phase2=1,2 must be used. 
       Processing: use wft2dx macro for positive tilt angles and wft2dy for negative 
       tilt angles. 
       wft2dx = wft2d(1,0,-1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,-1,0,1,0)
       wft2dy = wft2d(1,0,-1,0,0,-1,0,-1,0,1,0,1,1,0,-1,0)
       The following relationships can be used to inter-convert the frequencies (in Hz) 
       between the tilted, F1(+)F3, F1(-)F3 and the orthogonal, F1F3, F2F3 planes:       
         F1(+) = F1*cos(pra) + F2*sin(pra)  
         F1(-) = F1*cos(pra) - F2*sin(pra)
         F1 = 0.5*[F1(+) + F1(-)]/cos(pra)
         F2 = 0.5*[F1(+) - F1(-)]/sin(pra)
