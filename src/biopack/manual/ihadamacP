This sequence should be able to separate gly,ser,asn/asp,cys/aromatic,ala and 
thr. Thr appears for free in a separate subspectrum due to its high Cb-Cg 
coupling. When setting tauC3 (Cb->Ca & Cb->Cg) to 16ms, they appears mostly 
negative.
tauC1 (Cb->Ca transfer) can be optimized to the JCBCA value without being 
bothered by the Ca remaining from the first block. 
Using the Hadamard steps defined as below, the bands have the following signs:


had_flg		Thr	Gly	Ser	Ala	Asn/Asp		Rest(Cys/aro)
1		+	+	+	+	+		+
2		+	+	-	-	-		+
3		-	+	+	+	-		+
4		-	+	-	-	+		+
5		-	-	+	-	+		+
6		-	-	-	+	-		+
7		+	-	+	-	-		+	
8		+	-	-	+	+		+

epsilon value should be between 4 and 6ms.
- inverse Cb and CO at the same time in the first block.
  (double CB refocusing/ CO inversion and 1H refocusing) 
  The net effect of two consecutive double band pulses (see sign inversion
  1/JCbCO for fil_flg1='y') is a ~0 overall phase shift (compensated BS).
