HNCACO has a sensitivity limitation due to fast 13CO transverse 
relaxation and passive 13Calpha-13Cbeta coupling. This is a high-sensitivity 
'just-in-time' (JIT) HN(CA)CO pulse sequence that uniformly refocuses 
13Calpha-13Cbeta coupling while collecting 13CO shifts in real time. 
Sensitivity comparisons of the 3-D JIT HN(CA)CO, a CT-HMQC-based control, 
and HSQC-based control with selective 13Calpha inversion pulses were performed 
using a 2H/13C/15N labeled sample of the 29 kDa HCA II protein at 15 degrees C. 
The JIT expt. shows a 42% signal enhancement over the CT-HMQC-based experiment.
Compared to the HSQC-based experiment, the JIT experiment is 16% less sensitive 
for residues with proper 13Calpha refocusing and 13Calpha-13Cbeta decoupling. 
For the remaining residues, the JIT spectrum shows av. 106% sensitivity
gain over the HSQC-based experiment. The high-sensitivity JIT HNCACO experiment 
should be particularly beneficial for studies of large proteins to provide 13CO
resonance information regardless of residue type.

               CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

         Set dm  = 'nnn', dmm =  'ccc' 
         Set dm2 = 'nnn', dmm2 = 'ccc'  (TROSY)
         Set dm3 = 'nnn' for no 2H decoupling, or
                   'nyn' and dmm3 = 'cwc' for 2H decoupling. 

scale_CaCO:  This parameter is used to enlarge the c13 evolution time.
             When scale_CaCO is set to 1.0, full sensitivity is obtained;
             otherwise, set scale_CaCO to 0.8, so that 90% signals would be obtained,
             however, CO dimension gets additional 1.8 ms evolution time.
             This parameter is fixed in the pulse sequence code, but could be
             modified and re-compiled
