  gcbca_nhP.c

    3D CBCANH gradient sensitivity enhanced version.


    Correlates Cb(i),Ca(i) with N(i), NH(i) and N(i+1), NH(i+1).  Uses constant
    time evolution for the CaCb shifts and for the 15N shifts.
    
    Standard features include maintaining the 13C carrier in the CaCb region
    throughout using off-res SLP pulses; full power square pulses on 13C 
    initially when 13CO excitation is irrelevant; square pulses on the Ca and
    CaCb with first null at 13CO; one lobe sinc pulses on 13CO with first null
    at Ca; optional 2H decoupling when CaCb magnetization is transverse for 4 
    channel spectrometers.

    Magic-angle option for coherence transfer gradients.  TROSY option for
    N15/H1 evolution/detection.

    This sequence is modified from the sequence gcbca_co_nh.c (MRB) by BKJ
    12/6/96, corrected BKJ 12/11/96.   Revised and improved to a standard
    format by MRB, BKJ and GG for the BioPack, January 1997. 
    TROSY added Dec 98, based on similar addition to gNhsqc. Shaped pulses 
    calculated within pulse sequence code, Jan 99 (Version March 99).



        	  CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

    	Set dm = 'nnn', dmm = 'ccc' 
    	Set dm2 = 'nny', dmm2 = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for 15N decoupling.
	Set dm3 = 'nnn' for no 2H decoupling, or
		  'nyn'  and dmm3 = 'cwc' for 2H decoupling. 
  
    Must set = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI acquisition in
    t1 [13C]  and t2 [15N].

    The flag f1180/f2180 should be set to 'y' if t1/t2 is to be started at
    halfdwell time. This will give -90, 180 phasing in f1/f2. If it is set to
    'n' the phasing should be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.  Thus,
    set f1180='n' for (0,0) in 13C and f2180='n' for (0,0) in 15N.  f1180='y' is
    ignored if ni=0, and f2180='y' is ignored if ni2=0.



          	  DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF gcbca_nhP


    1. Obtain a printout of the Philosopy behind the BioPack development,
       and General Instructions using the macro: 
                                      "printon man('BioPack') printoff".
       These Detailed Instructions for gcbca_nhP may be printed using:
                                      "printon man('gcbca_nhP') printoff".
             
    2. Apply the setup macro "gcbca_nhP".  This loads the relevant parameter set
       and also sets ni=ni2=0 and phase=phase2=1 ready for a 1D spectral check.

    3. The delay zeta, between points c and d in the pulse sequence, is set
       to 6 ms by the pulse sequence code for the 1D check, or for 2D/15N 
       spectra, to provide a spectrum of large positive signals.
       The normal value for 2D/13C nmr, or 3D nmr, is 0.011 (11 ms), but at this
       value positive and negative signals approximately cancel in the 1D
       spectrum (see JMR 99, 201 for an explanation).  zeta is automatically 
       reset to the value in the dg2 parameter set (normally 11 ms) in the pulse
       sequence code for 2D/13C and 3D work (ie when ni>1).  

    4. Center H1 frequency on H2O (4.7ppm), C13 on 174ppm, and N15 frequency
       on the amide region (120ppm). The C13 frequency is calculated in the
       sequence to be at 46ppm, ie at Cab throughout the sequence.

    5. The H1 frequency is NOT shifted to the amide region during the sequence.
       The H1 DIPSI2 decoupling is controlled by the waltzB1 parameter.
       The value is specified in the new shapelib file after go or dps. 

    6. tauCH (1.7 ms) and timeTN (14 ms) were determined for alphalytic protease
       and are listed in dg2 for possible readjustment by the user.

    7. The coherence-transfer gradients using power levels
       gzlvl1 and gzlvl2 may be either z or magic-angle gradients. For the
       latter, a proper /vnmr/imaging/gradtable entry must be present and
       syscoil must contain the value of this entry (name of gradtable). The
       amplitude of the gzlvl1 and gzlvl2 should be lower than for a z axis
       probe to have the x and y gradient levels within the 32k range. For
       any value, a dps display (using power display) shows the x,y and z
       dac values. These must be <=32k.

    8. TROSY:
       Set TROSY='y' and dm2='nnn' for a TROSY spectrum of the bottom right
       peak of the 2D coupled NH quartet (high-field H1, low-field N15).  The 
       TROSY spectrum gives 50% S/N compared to the decoupled spectrum for a 
       small peptide.  To select any of the other three peaks of the 2D coupled
       quartet, in a clockwise direction from bottom right, change t4/t10
       from x/y to x/-y to -x/-y to -x/y.  NOTE, the phases of the SE train
       are almost the same as those determined for the gNhsqc sequence.  The
       major difference is that kappa is eliminated compared to normal
       gcbca_nhP so the N15 magnetization has not evolved with respect to the 
       attached H's.  I.e. the N15 state would be Ix rather than IySz if there 
       was no coherence gradient - this imparts a 90 degree shift so t8 is 
       changed to y (from x in the normal spectrum).  Also gzlvl1 is after the
       180 N15 pulse rather than before as in gNhsqc, so the sign of icosel 
       and the t4/t10 phase2 increments are also swapped compared to gNhsqc.       
   9.  The N15 t2 evolution and the sensitivity enhancement train is common
       to all g...._nh sequences and the pulse sequence code for these final
       sections is in the include file, bionmr.h.
