    3D NOESY-HSQC gradient sensitivity enhanced version for 15N, with
    H1-H1 NOESY in the first dimension, and N15 shifts in the second.

    optional magic-angle coherence transfer gradients

        1) first rgpulse of a regular 15N-edited NOESY is replaced by a (90H)-180(C,H)
    -90(C) pulse sandwich that is cycled so that the magnetization from protons 
    connected to C13 are cycled out and only the protons connected to C12 are frequency 
    labeled during the t1 period. Subsequently the Hs connected to C12 transfer 
    magnetization to protons connected to N15 and are detected through N15 and H(N15) 
    in the t2 and t3 periods.
 
        2) The protons connected to  15N also transfer magnetization to 15N connected
    protons and are not cycled out. Therefore, this version of the pulsesequence only 
    provides information of the CN region of the spectrum that is inter-chain noes.
    The N-N region however has both intra and interchain information.

    Standard features include optional 13C sech/tanh pulse on CO and Cab to 
    refocus 13C coupling during t1 and t2; one lobe sinc pulse to put H2O back 
    along z (the sinc one-lobe is significantly more selective than gaussian, 
    square, or seduce 90 pulses); preservation of H20 along z during t1 and the 
    relaxation delays; option of obtaining spectrum of only NH2 groups;

    Revised and improved to a standard format by MRB, BKJ and GG for the

    standard features within the pulse sequence code and associated macro.



        	  CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

    Set dm = 'nnn', dmm = 'ccc'
    Set dm2 = 'nny', dmm2 = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for N15 decoupling.

    Must set phase = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI acquisition in
    t1 [H1]  and t2 [N15].
   
    The flag f1180/f2180 should be set to 'y' if t1/t2 is to be started at
    halfdwell time. This will give -90, 180 phasing in f1/f2. If it is set to
    'n' the phasing should be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.  Thus,
    set f1180='n' for (0,0) in H1 and f2180='n' for (0,0) in N15.  f1180='y' is
    ignored if ni=0, and f2180='y' is ignored if ni2=0.



          	  DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF gnoesyNhsqc

         
    1. Obtain a printout of the Philosopy behind the ProteinPack development,
       and General Instructions using the macro: 
                                      "printon man('ProteinPack') printoff".
       These Detailed Instructions for gnoesyNhsqc may be printed using:
                                      "printon man('gnoesyNhsqc') printoff".
             
    2. Apply the setup macro "gnoesyNhsqc".  This loads the relevant parameter
       set and also sets ni=0 and phase=1 ready for a 1D spectral check.

    3. Centre H1 frequency on H2O (4.7ppm), C13 frequency on 35ppm, and N15 
       frequency on the amide region (120 ppm).

    4. Pulse and frequency calibrations are as for gNhsqc, or as generally
       used for ProteinPack.

    6. Splitting of resonances in the 1st or 2nd dimension by C13 coupling in 
       C13-enriched samples can be removed by setting C13refoc='y'.

    7. H2O preservation is achieved according to Kay et al, except that a sinc
       one-lobe selective pulse is used to put H2O back along z.  This is much
       more selective than a hard, Seduce1, or gaussian pulse.  H2O is cycled
       back to z as much as possible during t1 and t2.

    8. NH2 GROUPS:
       A spectrum of NH2 groups, with NH groups cancelled, can be obtained
       with flag NH2only='y'.  This utilises a 1/2J (J=94Hz) period of NH 
       J-coupling evolution added to t1 which cancels NH resonances and 
       inverts NH2 resonances (normal INEPT behaviour).  A 180 degree phase
       shift is added to a N15 90 pulse to provide positive NH2 signals.  The 
       NH2 resonances will be smaller (say 80%) than when NH2only='n'.
