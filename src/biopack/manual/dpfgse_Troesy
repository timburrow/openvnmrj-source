dpfgse_Troesy.c - rotating frame NOE experiment with T-Roesy modification 
              allows T-Roesy or standard cw Roesy

             OBSERVE TRANSMITTER SHOULD BE SET AT SOLVENT POSITION
             SATURATION,SPIN LOCK AND PULSES ALL USE OBS.XMTR

        pw = 90 degree pulse on protons (power level at "tpwr")
      tpwr = power level for the spin lock pulse(s)
  strength = amplitufe of the B1 mixing field (in Hz)
     compH = 1H amplifier compression factor
     T_flg = 'y' gives pulsed T-Roesy; 'n': cw Roesy
     phase = 1,2: F1 quadrature by the hypercomplex method
       mix = mixing time
 wrefshape = shape file of the 180 deg. selective refocussing pulse
             on the solvent (may be convoluted for
             multiple solvents)
   wrefpw  = pulse width for wrefshape (as given by Pbox)
   wrefpwr = power level for wrefshape (as given by Pbox)
  wrefpwrf = fine power for wrefshape
                by default it is 2048 needs optimization for
                multiple solvent with fixed wrefpw suppression only
       gt2 = gradient duration for the solvent suppression echo
    gzlvl2 = gradient power for the solvent suppression echo
   alt_grd = flag for alternating gradient sign in mix-dpfgse segment
     gstab = gradient stabilization delay
     sspul = 'y': activates gradient-90degree-gradient pulse prior to d1
       gt1 = gradient pulse duration for sspul
    gzlvl1 = gradient pulse amplitude for sspul
   satmode = activates transmitter presat at satfrq 
             (satfrq = tof; satmode='nnn' or satmode='ynn')
    satdly = length of saturation during relaxation delay  
    satpwr = power level for solvent saturation
  trim_flg = flag for an optional trim pulse at the end of the
                  sequence
                  set trim_flg='y' tu suppress protein background
      trim = pulse width of the trim pusle for trim_flg='y'
   trimpwr = power level for the trim pulse for trim_flg='y'
        nt = min:  multiple of 4; max:  multiple of 8
