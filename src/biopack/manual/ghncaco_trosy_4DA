  ghncaco_trosy_4DA.c - auto-calibrated version 
 
    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following
    experiment:

    4D hncaco with deuterium decoupling
	F1 	C-alpha
	F2 	Co
	F3 	N + JNH/2
	F-acq	HN- JNH/2

    This sequence uses the four channel configuration
         1)  1H             - carrier @ 4.7 ppm [H2O]
         2) 13C             - carrier @ 56 ppm (CA) and 174 ppm(Co)
         3) 15N             - carrier @ 120 ppm  
         4) 2H		    - carrier @ 4.5 ppm 

    Set dm = 'nnn', dmm = 'ccc' 
    Set dm2 = 'nnn', dmm2 = 'ccc' 
    Set dm3 = 'nnn', dmm2 = 'ccc' 

    Must set phase = 1,2, phase2=1,2, and phase3 = 1,2 for States-TPPI
    acquisition in t1 [Ca],t2[Co],and t2 [N]. [The fids must be manipulated
    (add/subtract) with 'grad_sort_nd' program (or equivalent) before regular
    processing for non-VNMR processing.]
    
    Flags
	fsat		'y' for presaturation of H2O
	fscuba		'y' for apply scuba pulse after presaturation of H2O
	f1180		'y' for 180 deg linear phase correction in F1 
		        	otherwise 0 deg linear phase correction
	f2180		'y' for 180 deg linear phase correction in F2
			    otherwise 0 deg linear phase correction
	fc180   	'y' for Co refocusing in t2
        sel_flg         'y' for active suppression of the anti-TROSY peak
        sel_flg         'n' for relaxation suppression of the anti-TROSY peak

	Standard Settings
   fsat='n',fscuba='n',mess_flg='n',f1180='n',f2180='y',f3180='n',fc180='n'

   Use ampmode statement = 'dddp'
   Note the final coherence transfer gradients have been split
   about the last 180 (H)

   Calibration of carbon pulses
	
	pwc       hard pulse (about 12 us at 600 MHz) at dhpwr
        pwc90     delta/sqrt(15) selective pulse applied at d_c90
        pwca180   delta/sqrt(3) selective pulse applied at d_c180
        pwca180dec pwca180+pad
        pwcareb   reburp 180 pulse (about 1600 us at 600MHz) applied at d_creb
	pwcosed    delta/sqrt(3) pulse applied at d_sed
                 USE delta/sqrt(3) and not seduce pulse
               In the case that jab_evolve == y
                  can use 250 us g3 pulses centered at 191.5 ppm at 800 MHz
        pwrbhp at d_rbhp (shrbhp) reburp pulses centered at 42 ppm; only used
                 when composite_flg == n

   Calibration of small agnle phase shift (set ni=1, ni2=1, ni3=1, phase=1,
   phase2=1,phase3=1)
        sphase  set fc180='y' and change sphase until get a null(no sginal).
                The right sphase is the value at the null plus 45 degrees

        sphase1 about zero.  Calibration is the same as that for sphase

Modified by L.E.Kay on Aug. 5, 2001 to include composite_flg. In the published
  version of the experiment during 13Ca evolution (periods A-D in Fig. 1
  of the paper) the 13Ca and 13Co 180 pulses are applied simultaneously using
  a composite 180. Need 14 us for 500, 12 us for 600 and 10 us for 800 for
  greater than 97% inversion/refocusing. If composite_flg == y then this is
  the approach to be taken. If composite_flg == n then C' and Ca pulses are
  applied as delta/sq(3) pulses.

There is an additional option and that is to ignore the evolution of Ca-Cb
couplings. At 800 MHz this may be the best alternative as the acq. times
have to be short of necessity. Set  jab_evolve = y

To set up as in Jacs paper: jab_evolve = n, composite_flg = y
To refocus jab (c-c alfa-beta couplings) set composite_flg = n and jab_evolve = n
To allow jab to evolve set jab_evolve = y
