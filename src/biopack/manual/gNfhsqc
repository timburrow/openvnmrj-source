 Nfhsqc    "Fast N15 hsqc using 3919 watergate suppression"
               "with options for Saturation Transfer Difference"

   minimum step cycling is 2
   program written by Susumu Mori and Chitrananda Abeygunawardana,Johns Hopkins
   modified for 3rd Channel operation BKJ 970430 
   TROSY option is included. When TROSY is selected use nt=8 (NM, Palo Alto)
   
   Modified by Eriks Kupce :
   the TROSY phase cycle corrected to pick the correct component and to use the 
   sensitivity enhanced version. The minimum phase cycle for TROSY reduced to 4 steps.
   Corrected the d2 timing in the TROSY version. Added soft watergate option via
   wtg3919 flag.   
   
   Use f1coef = '1 0 -1 0 0 1 0 1' for TROSY
   E.K., 17.05.2002.
   
   tau1 timing corrected for regular experiment (4*pwN/PI correction added)
   tau1 timing corrected for TROSY experiment
   f1180 flag added for starting t1 at half-dwell
   C13shape flag added for chosing betweem adiabatic or composite 13C refocussing pulse in t1 
   (Marco Tonelli and Klaas Hallenga, NMRFAM, Univ. Wisconsin).

   STD options added by Mike Osbourne, U.Montreal.

    Options are 1. No STD
                2. Saturation using shaped decoupling
                3. Saturation using a shaped-pulse train
                4. Saturation using Pbox-enerated shaped pulse train.
