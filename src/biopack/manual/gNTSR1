 gNTSR1  Off-resonance Trosy selected R1rho experiment  


   minimum step cycling is 8
   
   tau1 timing corrected for regular experiment (4*pwN/PI correction added)
   tau1 timing corrected for TROSY experiment
   f1180 flag for starting t1 at half-dwell

   C13refoc='y' uses refocussing 13C STUD or composite pulse in t1
     power and pulse width are automatically calculated for either one
   C13shape flag='y' adiabatic refocussing pulse in t1 
   C13shape flag='n' composite refocussing pulse in t1 

   wtg3919='y' does water suppression by watergate 3919

   The off-resonance B1 field is supplied by the waveform contained in
   the variable "slshape". It is a "spinlock"-type waveform and uses
   the power slpwr2, dmf of sldmf2 and res of sldres2. An example 
   waveform may be created using Pbox with the input string
     {tanhtan 0.004 0.0}
