  gcacb_tocsy_cmhm_sqA.c               

    (H)CACB_TOCSY_CmHm utilizing gradients and double sensitivity enhancement.
    Single quantum evolution in t1
    
    Uses optional magic-angle gradients.

    Correlates the sidechain aliphatic 13Ca and 13Cb resonances of a given amino acid
    with methyl groups.

    Set dof to 13CO region.

    Uses isotropic 13C mixing.

    Use enough 13C decoupling bandwidth(140ppm) to minimize any artifacts coming from
    other carbons.

        	  CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

    	Set dm = 'nny', dmm = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for 13C decoupling.
	Set dm3 = 'nnn' for no 2H decoupling, or
		  'nyn'  and dmm3 = 'w' for 2H decoupling. 
  
    Must set phase = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI acquisition in
    t1 [1H]  and t2 [13C].

    2D experiment in t1: wft2d(1,0,-1,0,0,1,0,1) (sensitivity-enhanced)
    2D experiment in t2: wft2d('ni2',1,0,-1,0,0,1,0,1) (sensitivity-enhanced)
    ( or just use wft2da or wft2da('ni2') after setting
      f1coef='1 0 -1 0 0 1 0 1'
      f2coef='1 0 -1 0 0 1 0 1'
     for 3D just use ft3d )
    
    The flag f1180/f2180 should be set to 'y' if t1/t2 is to be started at
    halfdwell time. This will give 90, -180 phasing in f1/f2. If it is set to
    'n' the phasing should be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.  Thus,
    set f1180='n' for (0,0) in 13C and f2180='n' for (0,0) in 15N.  f1180='y' is
    ignored if ni=0, and f2180='y' is ignored if ni2=0.

     If 2H decoupling is used, the 2H lock signal may become unstable because
     of 2H saturation.  Check that a 1D spectrum is stable/reproducible as 
     when 2H decoupling is not used.  You might also check this for d2 and d3
     equal to values achieved at say 75% of their maximum.  Remember to return
     d2=d3=0 before starting a 2D/3D experiment.

     gcacb_tocsy_cmhm_sqA.c is a version in which 
     the chemical shift of 13C is labeled solely under
     13C single quantum coherence during t1, whereas in gcacb_tocsy_cmhmA.c
     it is labeled partly under 13C-1H MQ and 13C SQ coherences. The 
     (SQ) scheme is much less sensitive to miscalibration of 1H pulse width.
     In gcacb_tocsy_cmhmA.c, any miscalibration of 1H pulse leads to spurious
     dispersive signals, possibly DQ/ZQ peaks, around the strong methyl correlations.
