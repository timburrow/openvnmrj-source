  gChmqcnoesy_Cfilt

    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiment:

    3D C13 edited noesy with separation via the carbon of the origination site 
    with purging so that NOEs are from carbon label to non-carbon label.
                       F1      1H		SW approx 4200 on 500
                       F2      13C		SW approx 3000 on 500
                       F3(acq) 1H 		SW approx 8000 on 500

    Uses three channels:
         1)  1H             - carrier @ 3.0 ppm 	  SW approx 4200 on 500
         2) 13C             - carrier @ 43 ppm [CA/CB]    SW approx 3000 on 500

    Set dm = 'nnnn', dmm = 'cccc' [NO 13C decoupling during acquisition].
    Set dm2 = 'nnnn', dmm2 = 'cccc'

    Typically run in D2O 

    Must set phase = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI
    acquisition in t1 [H]  and t2 [C].

    Flags
          satmode    'y' for presaturation of H2O
          f1180      'y' for 180deg linear phase correction in F1
                         otherwise 0deg linear phase correction in F1.
          f2180      'y' for 180deg linear phase correction in F2
 
    Standard Settings:
          satmode='n', f1180='n', f2180='n'
