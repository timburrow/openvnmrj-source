  PR42_sim_ghn_co_caP_TROSY

    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiment:

    4D projection-reconstruction hncoca (co and ca are in the same residue)with trosy
                       F1      CO
                       F2      CA
                       F3      15N + JNH/2
                       F4(acq) 1H (NH) - JNH/2

    This sequence uses the standard three channel configuration
         1)  1H             - carrier (tof) @ 4.7 ppm [H2O]
         2) 13C             - carrier (dof) @ 176 ppm [CO] or CA 55ppm
         3) 15N             - carrier (dof2)@ 119 ppm [centre of amide 15N]  
    
    Set dm = 'nnn', dmm = 'ccc' 
    Set dm2 = 'nnn', dmm2 = 'ccc'

    Flags
        satmode         'y' for presaturation of H2O
        fscuba          'y' for apply scuba pulse after presaturation of H2O
	fco180		'y' for checking N/NH 2D 
	fca180		'y' for checking N/NH 2D 
        sel_flg         'y' for active suppression of the anti-TROSY
        sel_flg         'n' for relaxation suppression of the anti-TROSY

	Standard Settings
        satmode='n',fscuba='n'

    Set the carbon carrier on the C' and use the waveform to pulse the
        c-alpha

    Modified by L. E. Kay on Aug. 22, 99 to include a sel_flg
    Modified by L.E.Kay on Aug. 9, 2001 to separate N and adiabatic pulses; especially
     for 800 MHz application, where the power to the probe is considerable.

    Modified on 12/03/03 by R. Venters to a projection reconstruction sequence.
    Also added Cb decoupling during Ca-CO transfers and Ca evolution.
    Modified on 10/07/04 by R. Venters to collect proper tilts
