  CCtocsyCA

    2D 13C observe 13C-13C TOCSY experiment.


    Uses constant time evolution for the 13C shifts. Set tn='C13', dn='H1', dn2='N15, dn3='H2'.

    Standard features include maintaining the 13C carrier in the Cab region
    throughout using off-res SLP pulses; square pulses on Cab with first
    null at 13CO.

 
    pulse sequence: A. Eletsky, O. Moreiera, H. Kovacs, and K. Pervushin
    JBNMR 26, 167-179 (2003).


    Must set phase = 1,2 for States-TPPI acquisition in t1 [13C].
    set dm2='nynn' dmm2='cgcc' 

    for 2H decoupling, set dm3='nyny' dmm3='cwcw'.

    Pulse sequence is optimized for VNMRS. Delays should be corrected for INOVA by subtracting
    WFG2_START_DELAY and WFG3_START_DELAY.
