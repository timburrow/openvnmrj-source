  T1D 

    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following
    experiment:

    2D 2H T1 measurment of samples with deuterium incorporation
    with resolution achieved by 2D 13C,1H CT. (Methyl groups)
    Used for high resolution high sensitivity 13C spectrum.

    Uses three channels:
         1)  1H             - 4.73 ppm 
         2) 13C             - 19.0 ppm 
         3) 15N             - 119.0 ppm  

    Set dm = 'nnny', dmm = 'cccp' [13C decoupling during acquisition].
    Set dm2 = 'nnnn', dmm2 = 'cccp'.

    Must set phase = 1,2 for States-TPPI
    acquisition in t1 [13C].
    
    The flag f1180 should be set to 'y' if t1 is 
    to be started at halfdwell time. This will give -90, 180
    phasing in f1. If it is set to 'n' the phasing will
    be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.

    Added deuterium flipback pulses, RM Oct 11, 1995.

    Records carbon chemical shift during the second CT period

    Modified by L.E.Kay, Jan 19,96 to ensure delays of 4e-6 
    prior to power delays

    Modified by L.E.Kay on Jan 29,96 to correct for phase difference between
    Re-burp and hard pulses.

    Modified by A. Lee to make into pseudo-3D experiment

    Relaxation delays(z_array) are "hard-coded", here set for eight values. The
    variable ni2 should be used to specify the total number of mixing times.    
    Duplicate times are included for a consistency check
