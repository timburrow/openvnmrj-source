   (H)NCA(N)H with double-TROSY feature
    Use for 2H-13C-15N labeled proteins. 
  
 Correlations: 
          t1(ni)   : N[i],N[i-1],N[i+1]
          t2(ni2)  : C[i],C[i-1]
          t3(np/at): HN[i]

 Depending upon tmeCN and size of the protein: 
  [default] timeCN 14-16ms    auto-peak N[i] has different sign than cross-peaks N[i +/-1] 
            timeCN 20-24ms    auto-peak N[i] almost absent, cross-peaks have larger intensity

 Sensitivity is about 1/2 of HNCACB experiment
 (See Supplementary material for hNCAnh experiment paper)

 This is an "A" style of the pulse sequence programming: 
  all shaped pulses (except proton) are generated automatically on-the-fly by Pbox calls.
  User needs to have only three reference (calibration) parameters per channel: 
  pw90, pw90 power level and compression factor (see BioPack manual)

  For any automatically generated shaped pulse,shape parameters are determined by a single
 "Pbox input string parameter" (see Pbox manual).
   
     Example: 180-degree shaped pulse on CO while sitting on CA will be  
              determined by "Pbox input string" parameter 
              
              CO180offCA_in_str = 'gaus 60p 120p 0 0 180', i.e.
              Gaussian shape, covering 60ppm, offset by 120ppm,
              spin state 0, pulse phase 0, flip angle on resonance 180 degrees.

     NOTE:    due to this particular pulse sequence implementation peculiarities,  
              arraying  string parameter "whatever_pulse_in_str" will not work:
              experiment will run with whatever_pulse_in_str = first-element-of-array  

   Jun  2012 : SOME CARE TAKEN FOR INOVA-TYPE AP DELAYS; NOT TESTED ON INOVA SYSTEMS
 
    exp_mode='t' for trosy in the double-trosy hNcaNH

    exp_mode='R' to check signal in 1D and test relaxation losses during 2*timeCN 
                 (~2*16ms=32ms) transfers
    
    set dm3='nyn' for deuterium decoupling on CA during 2*timeCN transfer


How to set up:

  1a)  Set exp_mode='R', timeCN=0.0005 (=500us), run 1D expriment.
  1b)  array  gzlvl6 (coherence-selection decoding gradient) for max transfer efficiency
       at this stage, 1D sensitivity should be almost the same as regular TROSY-HNCA

  2a) [optional] Check 2H decoupler efficiency

      Set exp_mode='R', timeCN=0.016, dm3='nnn','nyn'. Run arrayed 1D 
      There should be a noticable difference between 2H-decoupled and coupled spectra.
      Calibrate 2H decoupling parameters by the button on the Setup/Calibrations page.

  2b) [optional] Check relaxation during 2*timeCN
      Set exp_mode='R',  array timeCN=0.0005, 0.003, 0.006 ... up to 0.025 (25ms)
      Run this arrayed 1D to get an idea of CA* T2*. (that would help to choose timeCN,
      see supplemetary for the original paper for hNcaNH)

  3)  set exp_mode='t', timeCN around 16ms, dm3='nyn' and run as 3D with normal (linear)
      sampling or with NUS (Non-Uniform Sampling, recommended)

  timeTN1 = first N[i]-> Ca[i,i-1] tranfer 11-13ms, 1/(4*JNCa)          (12.4ms)
  timeCN  = Ca[i,i-1]-> N[i,i+1,i-1] transfer, 16-25ms          
  timeTN  = last NCa->N transfer, shortened by 1/(4JHN) = timeTN1-tauNH (10ms)
