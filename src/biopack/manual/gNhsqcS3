  gNhsqcS3
    
    HSQC gradient sensitivity enhanced version for N15.
    Set dm2='nnn'

    For NH:
      Set NH2='n'
      Set abfilter='a' or 'b', phase=1,2 for the subspectral editing i.e. to select
      a or b state of 1JNH doublet. Use wft2d(1,0,-1,0,0,-1,0,-1).
      Set abfilter='a','b' and phase=1,2 for interleaved collection. Set array='abfilter,phase'

    For NH2:
      Set NH2='y'
      Set abfilter='a' or 'b', phase=1,2 for the subspectral editing i.e. to select
      inner or outer lines of 1JNH2 doublet of doublets. Use wft2d(1,0,-1,0,0,-1,0,-1).
      Set abfilter='a','b' and phase=1,2 for interleaved collection. Set array='abfilter,phase' 

    For Interleaved collection:
      for one component use wft2d(1,0,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,-1,0,0,0,0) and
      for other component,  wft2d(0,0,0,0,1,0,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,-1) 

      for both components (s/n reduced by sqrt(2)):
       wft2d(1,0,-1,0,1,0,-1,0,0,-1,0,-1,0,-1,0,-1)

        	  CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

    Set dm = 'nnn', dmm = 'ccc'
    Set dm2 = 'nnn', dmm2 = 'ccc'
    Set dm3='nyn', dmm2='cwc' for 2H decoupling using 4th channel

    Must set phase = 1,2  for States-TPPI acquisition in t1 [N15].
    
    The flag f1180 should be set to 'y' if t1 is to be started at halfdwell
    time. This will give -90, 180 phasing in f1. If it is set to 'n' the 
    phasing should be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.  Thus,
    set f1180='n' for (0,0) in N15.  f1180='y' is ignored if ni=0.


       Center H1 frequency on H2O (4.7ppm), C13 frequency on 100ppm, and N15 
       frequency on the amide region (120 ppm).

       Splitting of resonances in the N15 dimension by C13 coupling in C13
       enriched samples can be removed by setting C13refoc='y'.

       H2O preservation is achieved with sinc one-lobe selective pulse 
       used to put H2O back along z.

       The coherence-transfer gradients using power levels
       gzlvl1 and gzlvl2 may be either z or magic-angle gradients. For the
       latter, a proper /vnmr/imaging/gradtable entry must be present and
       syscoil must contain the value of this entry (name of gradtable). The
       amplitude of the gzlvl1 and gzlvl2 should be lower than for a z axis
       probe to have the x and y gradient levels within the 32k range. For
       any value, a dps display (using power display) shows the x,y and z
       dac values. These must be <=32k.
