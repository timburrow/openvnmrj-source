/*  rna_CPMGnoesy.c

    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiment:

    A 2D N15-correlated NOESY employing a CPMG pulse train instead of regular
    INEPT transfer for improved magnetization transfer of exchange broadened
    resonances. Optional C13 refocusing.


                      NOTE dof MUST BE SET AT 110ppm ALWAYS
                      NOTE dof2 MUST BE SET AT 200ppm ALWAYS


    pulse sequence: Mulder, F.A.A. et al, J. Biom. NMR, 8 (1996) 223-28.



                  CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

    Set dm = 'nny', dmm = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for C13 decoupling.
    Set dm2 = 'nny', dmm2 = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for N15 decoupling.

    Must set phase = 1,2  for States-TPPI acquisition in t1 [N15].

    The flag f1180 should be set to 'y' if t1 is to be started at halfdwell
    time. This will give -90, 180 phasing in f1. If it is set to 'n' the
    phasing should be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.  Thus,
    set f1180='n' for (0,0) in N15.  f1180='y' is ignored if ni=0.



                  DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF rna_CPMGnoesy


    1. Obtain a printout of the Philosopy behind the RnaPack development,
       and General Instructions using the macro:
                                      "printon man('RnaPack') printoff".
       These Detailed Instructions for rna_CPMGnoesy may be printed using:
                                      "printon man('rna_CPMGnoesy') printoff".

    2. Apply the setup macro "rna_CPMGnoesy".  This loads the relevant parameter set
       and also sets ni=0 and phase=1 ready for a 1D spectral check.

    3. Centre H1 frequency on H2O (4.7ppm), C13 frequency on 110ppm, and N15
       frequency on the aromatic N region (200 ppm).

    4. CPMG pulse train:
       ncyc should be set to multiple of 8 (8, 16 or 24).

    5. SETTING OF SW1:
       dof2 is set to 85ppm during the N15 labeling (tof set to 7.5ppm) and
       shifted to 120ppm for efficient decoupling during t2.
       dof is set to 110ppm for efficient C13 decoupling.

       Check the folding of the imino resonances in a N15 HSQC. Since the
       NOEs are N15-correlated it is important not to fold imino N15
       resonances on amino N15 resonances.
       Since dof2 is fixed in all N15 HSQC sequences (85ppm) change sw1 for
       proper folding. sw1=60ppm is usually a good starting value.

    6. Splitting of resonances in the N15 dimension by C13 coupling in C13
       enriched samples can be removed by setting C13refoc='y'.
