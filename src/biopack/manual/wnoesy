            2D cross relaxation experiment.  It can be performed in
            either phase-sensitive or absolute value mode.  Either
            TPPI or the hypercomplex method can be used to achieve
            F1 quadrature in a phase-sensitive presentation.  No
            attempt is made to suppress J-cross peaks in this pulse
            sequence.

           WET suppression available in relaxation delay and/or mix period
           gradients can suppress radiation damping in t1 and/or mix period
 

  Parameters:

       mix = mixing time.
     phase =   0: gives non-phase-sensitive experiment (P-type peaks);
                  nt(min) = multiple of 16
                  nt(max) = multiple of 64

             1,2: gives HYPERCOMPLEX phase-sensitive experiment;
               3: gives TPPI phase-sensitive experiment;
                  nt(min) = multiple of  8
                  nt(max) = multiple of 32

      pwN,pwNlvl   pw90 for N15 on channel 3 at power level pwNlvl
      pwC,pwClvl   pw90 for C13 on channel 2 at power level pwClvl
             wet   set to 'yn' for wet in relaxation delay
                          'ny' for wet in mix period
                          'yy' for both
                          'nn' for neither
      wet pulses may be different in relaxation and mix (could have multisite
          suppression in mix period with longer pulses)
