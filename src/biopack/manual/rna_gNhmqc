 rna_gNhmqc


	This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiment:

    Gradient HMQC for N15 in D2O or in H2O employing jump-return pulses


                      NOTE dof MUST BE SET AT 110ppm ALWAYS
                      NOTE dof2 MUST BE SET AT 200ppm ALWAYS


	                  CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

    JNH is usually set to the true coupling constant value. The 1/2JNH
    delay is set to 5.26ms (95Hz) as default value and can be changed
    by setting JNH.

    Set dm = 'nny', dmm = 'ccg' for C13 garp1-decoupling.
    Set dm2 = 'nny', dmm2 = 'ccg' for N15 garp1-decoupling.

    Must set phase = 1,2  for States-TPPI acquisition in t1 [N15].

    No half-dwell time option. Phase suggestions: lp1=0 rp1=-180 with first
    two complex points in t1 linear predicted to remove intensity distortions
    coming from finite length of jumpreturn. Phasing of lp1 in F1 should be
    reasonalbly close to zero, permitting use of LP.
    
                  DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF rna_gNhmqc

    1. Apply the setup macro "rna_gNhmqc".  This loads the relevant parameter set
       and also sets ni=0 and phase=1 ready for a 1D spectral check.

    2. Splitting of resonances in the N15 dimension by C13 coupling in C13
       enriched samples can be removed by setting C13refoc='y'.

    3. Setting of GRADIENTS:

	-G0 not too strong (500us/2G)
	-G1 can be strong for good H2O-suppression (500us/16G)

    4. Sklenar's Radiation Damping suppression
       (J. Mag. Reson. A, 114, 132-135 (1995)

        -set gzlvlr=0.5G/cm

    5. SETUP: dof2 is changed automatically (diff just for jumpret='y')
	imino='y'
	-IMINO-HMQC:	sw=22ppm
			sw1=25ppm
			diff=8ppm*sfrq Hz (~13ppm)
			dof=110ppm
			dof2=155ppm
	amino='y'
	-AMINO-HMQC:	sw=12ppm (folds iminos)
                        sw1=40ppm
                        diff=2ppm*sfrq Hz (~7ppm) 
                        dof=110ppm
                        dof2=85ppm

        diff-values should be optimized in that range!!
