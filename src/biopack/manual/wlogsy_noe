Parameters:
        sspul           - flag for optional GRD-90-GRD steady-state sequence
        gt0             - gradient duration for sspul
        gzlvl0          - gradient power for sspul
        mix             - mixing time
        gzlvlhs         - gradient power for the HS pulse during mix (< 1G/cm)
        led             - longitudinal Eddy-current compensation delay (2 msec)
        wselshape       - shape file of the 180 deg. H2O selection pulse       
        wselpw          - pulse width for wselshape (as given by Pbox)
        wselpwr         - power level for wselshape (as given by Pbox)
        alt_grd         - alternate gradient sign(s) on even transients
        gt1             - gradient duration for the solvent selection echo
        gzlvl1          - gradient power for the solvent selection echo
        wrefshape       - shape file of the 180 deg. selective refocussing pulse
                                on the solvent (may be convoluted for
                                                multiple solvents)
        wrefpw          - pulse width for wrefshape (as given by Pbox)
        wrefpwr         - power level for wrefshape (as given by Pbox)
        wrefpwrf        - fine power for wrefshape
                                by default it is 2048
                                needs optimization for multiple solvent
                                        with fixed wrefpw suppression only
        gt2             - gradient duration for the solvent suppression echo
        gzlvl2          - gradient power for the solvent suppression echo
        gstab           - gradient stabilization delay
        trim_flg	- flag for an optional trim pulse at the end of the
				sequence to suppress protein background
        trim		- length of the trim pulse for trim_flg='y'
        trimpwr		- power level for trim if trim_flg='y'
        tof             - transmitter offset (set on resonance for H2O)
        compH           - amplifier compression factor for 1H

The water selection shape and the water refocusing shape can be created/updatedted
using the "update_wselshape" and "update_wrefshape" macros, respectively. For
multiple frequency solvent suppression the wrefshape file needs to be created
manually.
