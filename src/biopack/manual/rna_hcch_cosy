/*  rna_hcch_cosy.c

    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiment:

    2D or 3D HCCH-COSY or RELAY with gradients in H2O or D2O and with editing
    of spectral regions.

                      NOTE dof MUST BE SET AT 110ppm ALWAYS
                      NOTE dof2 MUST BE SET AT 200ppm ALWAYS

    STUD+ decoupling    Bendall & Skinner, JMR, A124, 474 (1997) and in press



    In all the above cases:
    * H2 coupling in triply-labelled samples is refocused by dm3='nyn'.
    * Efficient STUD+ decoupling is invoked with STUD='y' without need to
    set any parameters.
    (STUD+ decoupling- Bendall & Skinner, JMR, A124, 474 (1997) and in press)
     
    STUD DECOUPLING.   SET STUD='y':
       Setting the flag STUD='y' overrides the decoupling parameters listed in
       dg2 and applies STUD+ decoupling instead.  In consequence is is easy
       to swap between the decoupling scheme you have been using to STUD+ for
       an easy comparison.  The STUD+ waveforms are calculated for your field
       strength at the time of BioPack installation and RF power is 
       calculated within the pulse sequence.  The calculations are for the most 
       peaks being greater than 90% of ideal. If you wish to compare different 
       decoupling schemes, the power level used for STUD+ can be obtained from 
       dps - subtract 3dB from that level to compare to decoupling schemes at
       a continuous RF level such as GARP.  The value of 90% has
       been set to limit sample heating as much as possible.  If you wish to 
       change STUD parameters, for example to increase the quality of decoupling
       (and RF heating) change the 95% level for the centerband
       by changing the relevant number in the macro makeSTUDpp and 
       rerun the macro (don't use 100% !!).  (At the time of writing STUD has
       been coded to use the coarse attenuator, because the fine attenuator
       is not presently included in the fail-safe calculation of decoupling 
       power which aborts an experiment if the power is too high - this may
       lower STUD efficiency a little).


        	  CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

    	Set dm2 = 'nny', dmm = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for 13C decoupling.
	Set dm3 = 'nnn' for no 2H decoupling, or
		  'nyn'  and dmm3 = 'cwc' for 2H decoupling. 
  
    Must set phase = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI acquisition in
    t1 [1H]  and t2 [13C].
    2D experiment in t1: wft2da
    2D experiment in t2: wft2d('ni2',1,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0)
    ( or with 5.2F or above just use wft2da or wft2da('ni2') after setting
      f2coef='1 0 0 0 0 0 -1 0'
     for 3D just use ft3da )
    2D transforms using 3D data set will transform properly with the
    standard wft2da macro.
    F1F3-plane: wft2d('ni',1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0)
    F2F3-plane: wft2d('ni2',1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0,0)

    
    The flag f1180/f2180 should be set to 'y' if t1 is to be started at
    halfdwell time. This will give -90, 180 phasing in f1/f2. If it is set to
    'n' the phasing should be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.  Thus,
    set f1180 = 'n' for (0,0) in 1H and f2180 = 'n' for (0,0) in 13C.


          	  DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF rna_hcch_cosy

    1. Obtain a printout of the Philosopy behind the RnaPack development,
       and General Instructions using the macro:
                                      "printon man('RnaPack') printoff".
       These Detailed Instructions for rna_hcch_cosy may be printed using:
                                      "printon man('rna_hcch_cosy') printoff".

    2. Apply the setup macro "rna_hcch_cosy".  This loads the relevant parameter set
       and also sets ni=ni2=0 and phase=phase2=1 ready for a 1D spectral check.

    3. Centre H1 frequency on H2O (4.7ppm), N15 frequency on the aromatic N
       region (200 ppm), and C13 frequency on 110ppm.

    4. H2O_flg = 'y' for H2O samples, 'n' for D2O samples

    5. CHOICE OF C13 REGION:
       ribose='y' gives a spectrum of ribose resonances centered on dof=80ppm.
                                                             Set sw  to  5ppm.
                                                             Set sw1 to  4ppm.
                                                             Set sw2 to 55ppm.

       aromatic='y' gives a spectrum of pyrimidine-aromatic groups. dof is shifted
       automatically by the pulse sequence code to 130ppm.   Set sw1 to 10ppm.
                                                             Set sw2 to 60ppm.

       Setting SHAPE='n' and ribose='y' folds pyrimidine-aromatic groups.
							     Set sw1 to 10ppm.
							     Set sw2 to 60ppm.

       Use of SHAPE is only recommended for optimizing the setup. Do not use for
       2D or 3D experiment!!!!

    6. DELAY TIMES (JCH and JCC):
       These are listed in dg/dg2 for possible change by the user. JCH is used
       to calculate the 1/4J time (lambda=0.94*1/4J) for H1 CH coupling evolution
       and the 1/3J time (tCH) for C13 evolution.
       Lambda is calculated a little lower (0.94) than the theoretical time to
       minimise relaxation.
       JCC is used to calculate the delay (tCC=1/8*J) for COSY transfer and
       delay (tCCr) for RELAY transfer.
         ribose CH/CH2:           JCH=145Hz         JCC = 35Hz
         aromatic CH:             JCH=180Hz         JCC = 70Hz

    7. CHOICE OF SEQUENCE:
       RELAY='y' adds relay transfer and allows you to run 2D or 3D HCCH RELAY.
       Not with aromatic='y'.
       For 2D set ni2=0.

    8. STUD DECOUPLING.   SET STUD='y':
       Setting the flag STUD='y' overrides the decoupling parameters listed in
       dg2 and applies STUD+ decoupling (80ppm) instead. For further information
       refer to rna_gChsqc.

    9. If 2H decoupling is used, the 2H lock signal may become unstable because
       of 2H saturation.  Check that a 1D spectrum is stable/reproducible as 
       when 2H decoupling is not used.  You might also check this for d2 and d3
       equal to values achieved at say 75% of their maximum.  Remember to return
       d2=d3=0 before starting a 2D/3D experiment.
