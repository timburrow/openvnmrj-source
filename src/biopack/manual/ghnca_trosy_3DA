  ghnca_trosy_3DA - auto-calibrated version of the original sequence
 
    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following
    experiment:

    TROSY-based 3D hnca with deuterium decoupling
	F1 	C-alpha
	F2 	N + JNH/2
	F-acq	HN - JNH/2

    This sequence uses the four channel configuration
         1)  1H             - carrier @ 4.7 ppm [H2O]
         2) 13C             - carrier @ 56 ppm (CA)
         3) 15N             - carrier @ 120 ppm  
         4) 2H		    - carrier @ 4.5 ppm 

    Set dm = 'nnn', dmm = 'ccc' 
    Set dm2 = 'nnn', dmm2 = 'ccc' [NO 15N decoupling during acquisition]
    Set dm3 = 'nnn', dmm2 = 'ccn' 

    Must set phase = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI
    acquisition in t1 [Ca]  and t2 [N]. [The fids must be manipulated
    (add/subtract) with 'grad_sort_nd' program (or equivalent) before regular
    processing.]
    
    Flags
	fsat		'y' for presaturation of H2O
	fscuba		'y' for apply scuba pulse after presaturation of H2O
	f1180		'y' for 180 deg linear phase correction in F1 
		        	otherwise 0 deg linear phase correction
	f2180		'y' for 180 deg linear phase correction in F2
			    otherwise 0 deg linear phase correction
	CT_flg		'y' for constant time of t1 (C-alpha)
	c180_flg	'y' for C-alpha refocusing in t1 (only for CT_flg='n')
        sel_flg         'y' for active suppression of the fast relaxing
                            component
                        'n' for relaxation suppression of the fast relaxing
                            component
                         NO longer needed as of Nov 30, 2004 
        nietl_flg       'y' suppresses the anti-trosy component with no losses in s/n
                         (D.Nietlispach, J.Biomol.NMR, 31,161(2005))
        shared_flg      'y' allows acquisition in F2 for longer than 2bigTN
                            using the shared constant time principle

	Standard Settings
	fsat='n',fscuba='n',f1180='n',f2180='n',CT_flg='y'
	c180_flg='n'

      Use ampmode statement = 'dddp'

    This scheme uses TROSY principle in 15N and NH with transfer of
    magnetization achieved using the enhanced sensitivity pfg approach,

    If sel_flg =='n' then the component of interest is not actively
    selected for; relaxation will attenuate the undesired component.
    Selection is achieved during the first N---> 13C' transfer.
 
    In general it is very difficult to present rules indicating when
    sel_flg should be set to y or n. In the case of applications at
    750 or 800 MHz and for correlation times in excess of 20 ns the
    sel_flg can be set to no and selection via relaxation should suffice.
 
    At lower field or for smaller molecules set sel_flg == 'y', for
    example at 500 or 600 MHz and for correlation times between 15 and 25ns
    set sel_flg=='y'. We have used sel_flg=='n' for a molecule with a
    correlation time of 43 ns and not observed any residual signal from
    the undesired component.

     Written by L.E.Kay, Oct 30, 1998  based on hnca_tydw.c

     Setup: Delta = difference in Hz between 176 and 58 ppm

     pwca90:  Use a field of delta/sq(15), on res.
     pwca180: Use a field of delta/sq(3), on res.
     pwcareb: Use a 375 us pulse centered at 45 ppm
     pwcosed: Use a ~ 220 us (at 600) seduce pulse for C' inversion
     pwco180: Used only if fCTCa == 'n'. Set to delta/sq(3), phase modulated
              by +delta Hz.

     Modified by L.E.Kay on March 3, 1999 to insert a Ca purge after the
     15N evolution time

     Modified by L.E.Kay to include the Nietlispach method
        so that the anti-trosy component is eliminated without setting
        sel_flg to y

    USAGE: set nietl_flg to y
