 ghnco_JNHA.c

    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiment:

    3D JHN_HNCO For the measurement of H-N dipolar coupling constant.
    ni(t1) --> 13CO
    ni2(t2)--> 15N

    OFFSET POSITION
       tof =   ~4.75 ppm (1H on water).
       dof =   174 ppm (13CO).
       dof2 =  120 ppm (15N region).

    Magic-angle option for coherence transfer gradients.

        	  CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

    	Set dm = 'nnn', dmm = 'ccc' 
    	Set dm2 = 'nny', dmm2 = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for 15N decoupling.

    The waltz16 field strength is enterable (waltzB1).
    Typical values would be ~6-8ppm, (3500-5000 Hz at 600 MHz).
  

   Must set phase = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI acquisition in
   t1 [C13]  and t2 [N15].
    
   The flag f1180/f2180 should be set to 'y' if t1/t2 is to be started at
   halfdwell time. This will give -90, 180 phasing in f1/f2. If it is set to
   'n' the phasing should be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.  Thus,
   set f1180='n' for (0,0) in C13 and f2180='n' for (0,0) in N15.  f1180='y' is
   ignored if ni=0, and f2180='y' is ignored if ni2=0.

   The autocal and checkofs flags are generated automatically in Pbox_bio.h
   If these flags do not exist in the parameter set, they are automatically 
   set to 'y' - yes. In order to change their default values, create the flag(s) 
   in your parameter set and change them as required. 
   The available options for the checkofs flag are: 'y' (yes) and 'n' (no). 
   The offset (tof, dof, dof2 and dof3) checks can be switched off individually 
   by setting the corresponding argument to zero (0.0).
   For the autocal flag the available options are: 'y' (yes - by default), 
   'q' (quiet mode - suppress Pbox output), 'r' (read from file, no new shapes 
   are created), 's' (semi-automatic mode - allows access to user defined 
   parameters) and 'n' (no - use full manual setup, equivalent to the original 
   code).
