  Uses coherence selection and magic angle gradient pulses.

 Ref: Stephan Grzesiek and Ad Bax,  JMR, B102, 103-106 (1993).

    Uses three channels:
         1)  1H   (t3)       - carrier  4.7 ppm (tof)
         2) 13CA  (t2, ni2)  - carrier  56 ppm  (dof)
            13CO  (t1, ni)   - carrier  174 ppm 
         3) 15N              - carrier  120 ppm (dof2) 

    gzcal = gcal for z gradient (gauss/dac),   
    calibrate using profile experiment
    mag_flg = y,  using magic angle pulsed field gradient
             =n,  using z-axis gradient only

    The waltz16 field strength is enterable (waltzB1).
    Typical values would be ~6-8ppm, (3500-5000 Hz at 600 MHz).

       The coherence-transfer gradients using power levels
       gzlvl6 and gzlvl9 may be either z or magic-angle gradients. For the
       latter, a proper /vnmr/imaging/gradtable entry must be present and
       syscoil must contain the value of this entry (name of gradtable). The
       amplitude of the gzlvl6 and gzlvl9 should be lower than for a z axis
       probe to have the x and y gradient levels within the 32k range. For
       any value, a dps display (using power display) shows the x,y and z
       dac values. These must be <=32k.
