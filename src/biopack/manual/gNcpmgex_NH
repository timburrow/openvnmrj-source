       This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiments:
        "Constant Relaxation Time CPMG experiment for NH" to identify Rex due to
        (millisecond) motions. The resultant spectral intensity is attenuated by
        an average of Nx and NyHz relaxation rates, with a contribution Rex
        that is dependent on the pulse spacing (2*tauCPMG) employed.

    This sequence uses the standard three channel configuration
         1)  1H             - carrier (tof) @ 4.7 ppm [H2O]
         2) 13C             - carrier (dof) @  57 ppm [CA]
         3) 15N             - carrier (dof2)@ 119 ppm [centre of backbone amide NH]

            (note there is a small mistake in their sequence (Fig.1);
             the second 1H 90 degree pulse should have phase y)

       If necessary one can do standard presaturation.  Note: presaturation
       is done using the transmitter with the power level set by 'tsatpwr'
       Irradiation is done with the carrier sitting at tofps. One can assign
       a different value to tof (e.g. center of amides) if required.

                 dmm= 'cccp'
                 dseq='waltz16'
       This sequence will then use the a waveform to give a waltz
       sequence at the appropriate times. (Of course, any other decoupling
       sequence could also be used instead of waltz.)

       Original sequence has poor water suppression at high field
                for long time_T2 due to radiation damping
       A watergate strategy is employed in conjunction with weak
                bipolar gradients during t1.

                possibility for watergate pulses

       Modified by L.E.Kay on Dec. 3, 2002 for application to carbon samples.
            Use an adiabatic pulse (400 us), centered at 117 ppm.

       Modified by L.E.Kay on Dec. 6, 2004 to include comp_flg which attempts to compensate
            for changes in duty cycle that affect cryogenic probe performance and cause R2,eff to 
            increase with B1; set comp_flg to y and ncyc_max to the max ncyc that you are using.

       Modified by L.E.Kay on June 22, 2005 to move compensation immediately prior to d1 period.
            Simulations establish that this will not affect initial proton magnetization 

            The compensating pulse duration is automatically calculated, but the amplitude should
            be empirically determined to generate the same effective field. A single pulse is used
            at lower power to avoid coil heating in cryogenic probes.(N.Murali, Varian 12/05)

       Modified from  N15_CPMG_Rex_NH_fm_800_v5.c for BioPack (GG, Varian  Jan 06):

        Shaped pulses can be automatically calculated and power levels/pulse widths set

 If comp_flg='y' there is a N15 pulse applied after d1 to compensate for RF/coil
 heating from the cpmg pulse train. This pulse be longest for the ncyc small and
 increases with ncyc to maintain a constant heating as a function of ncyc. Cryogenic
 probe tuning and shimming can be sensitive to power dissapation, so this compensates
 for the heating. Room temperature probes are not as sensitive to coil heating or
 deshimming, but may experience sample heating.

 The pulse is applied at dpwr2_comp power and the duration is calculated within the
 pulse sequence. The power should be determined by setting up a cpmg pulse train
 for the maximum ncyc to be used, starting the sequence, and then determining the
 heating power remaining (for a cold probe) after attaining steady-state. This should
 be done with comp_flg='n'. Then, set the N15 power levels other that dpwr2_comp to
 zero,ncyc=0 and set comp_flg='y'. Set ncyc_max to the largest ncyc value to be used
 in the queue of experiments. Try various compensation power levels until the heating
 power value achieves the same level as above. This represents a power level that
 produces the same heating as the cpmg pulse train.

 Now re-set ncyc and the cpmg pulse train power level to their proper values and leave
 comp_flg='y'. Use sufficient steady-state pulses to get to a stable heater value and
 then run the series of 2D experiments as a function of ncyc, one after the other.

 Once this is done the heating characteristics should be very similar from sample to
 sample so that the same settings could be used.
