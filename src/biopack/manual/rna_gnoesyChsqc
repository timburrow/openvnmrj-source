    3D C13 edited noesy with separation via the carbon of the destination site

    Uses three channels:
         1)  1H             - carrier @ water  
         2) 13C             - carrier @ 110 ppm
         3) 15N             - carrier @ 200 ppm

    Set dm = 'nnny', [13C decoupling during acquisition].
    Set dm2 = 'nyny', [15N dec during t1 and acq] 

    Must set phase = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI
    acquisition in t1 [H]  and t2 [C].

    Set f1180 = 'y' and f2180 = 'y' for (90,-180) in F1 and (90,-180) in F2.

    If you set the C13 carrier to a value other than 110 ppm (such as 35 ppm),
    change the line
        dofa=dof+(125-110)*dfrq;
    below to
        dofa=dof+(125-35)*dfrq;

    N15 carrier is set to 80ppm (aminos) for wet='y' assumes H2O sample    

    STUD DECOUPLING.   SET STUD='y':

    LP in t2:
       The finite delays necessary during 13C evolution make the first few data
       points in t2 distorted in intensity. The timing is correct so that lp2
       may be set to zero, but the intensity distortion, particularly of the
       second complex point, lead to a "dish" aspect of the baseline. This is not
       due to the presence of a first-order phase correction (lp2), so adjustment
       of the timing of the pulse sequence events is not needed.
   
       One solution is to use a smaller sw2 with intentional folding. This can make
       the second d2 value large enough so there is enough time for the C=O
       refocusing pulse to be executed. For larger sw2's there is not enough time.
 
       A solution to this is to use linear prediction in t2, the 13C dimension.
       In VNMR you can both "fix up" the first few points using the rest of the
       data table as the basis set, as well as extend the data set for better F2
       resolution and less distortion from truncation. The macro "setlp2" can be
       used in the format "setlp2(desired ni2, acquired ni2, #fixed)". Set
       "desired ni2" to be the final extended data size, "acquired ni2" to be the
       total # of increments to be used as a basis (it may be less than ni2, for
       example if the experiment is running), and "#fixed" to the number of
       initial points in t2 to be predicted (typically 2-4). Try this with a 2D
       data set for varying numbers of fixed points until the baseline is sufficiently
       flat in F2.
