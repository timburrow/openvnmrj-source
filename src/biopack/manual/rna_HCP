    Must set phase = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for hypercomplex in t1 and t2.

    Typical acquisition times are  ms [t1],  ms [t2], and  ms [t3]
       with 128 complex [t1], 32 complex [t2], and 512 real [t3].

    Use with D2O-sample, WATER='y' gives less signal!!
    Decoupling should be dm='nny' and dm2='nny' (P31-H3'/H5'/H5'' coupling!)
