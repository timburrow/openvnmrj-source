This experiment permits the measurement of cross-correlated relaxation rates between NH DD
and 15N CSA. It is intended for large molecules and/or high fields where the interference
effect is significant. For CCR < 6 s-1, traditional indirect methods may be better.

Tct sets the constant-time delay. Delta sets the proton inversion pulse position
( 0 =< Delta <= Tct ). A proper value of Tct can be chosen by setting
Delta =0,Tct. Optimal performance is expected when the intensity at Delta=Tct is around 1/3
of that at Delta=0. This criteria should be applied to signals of interest rather than
to the slowly relaxing terminal residues. Delta is to be arrayed, e.g. using a
pseudo-code like: array('Delta',n,0,Tct/(n-1))

15N chem shift evolves during Tct. If Tct is set too short in cases where CCR is large,
a semi-constant time setup takes effect automatically. The user doesn't have to do
anything specific.

This pulse sequence also allows measurement of CCR by the TROSY-antiTROSY method. In this case,
"overide_kappa" flag needs to be set to 'y' dn overide_kappa='y'. kappa should
be zero.

To measure TROSY relaxation rates, set Delta=0 and vary Tct, or
co-vary Delta and Tct (at equal values) to measure anti-TROSY rates.
