 sofastNhmqcA 

 "A" version of sofastNhmqc.c. This offers constant-time evolution and the
 option of user-selectable Variable Angle selective pulse to begin the exp.
 The variable "fla" is used to select the proper vap file from wavelib. If
 shname1 is not 'vap', a pc9 default shape is used (for the flip angle "fla".

   ab_flg='a','b'  and  dm2='nnn'for IPAP              
   requires no 15N decoupling                  

If ipap_flg='n' the experiment is States-Haberkorn and uses default
coefficients for wft2da (non-sensitivity enhanced processing).

With ipap_flg='y' and ab_flg='a','b' phase=1,2 array='ab_flg,phase'
you can acquire both antiphase and in-phase spectra at the same time. 

        wft2d(1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0,0)     for anti-phase signals
        wft2d(0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1)     for in-phase signals
        wft2d(1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0,-1)    for sum (one component)
        wft2d(1,0,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0,1)    for diff (other component)

The BioPack setup macro (sofastNhmqc) will use Pbox to create
the necessary shaped pulses and decoupling patterns. It will also
use the created shapefiles to obtain parameter values for the pulse
widths and power levels (and dmf value for decoupling).
