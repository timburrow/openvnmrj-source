 sea-gCLNfhsqc

        2D 1H-15N fhsqc experiments only on water accessable residues
        for N15- or N15/C13-labeled proteins, using CLEANEX-PM mixing scheme.
      
        For N15/C13-labeled samples, both C13 double filter and spin-echo filter
        can be used to eliminate CH-NH NOE and TOCSY contributions. 
            use C13 double filter by setting 
               C13filter='y' (the parameter "fact" has no efftect.
         or use spin-echo filter by setting
               C13filter='n', fact=3 (odd number).     
        
        For N15-labeled samples, only spin-echo filter can be used to eliminate
        CH-NH NOE and TOCSY contributions by setting
               C13filter='n', fact=3 (odd number).
               
        Set f1180='y' to indentify the folded peaks, 
            then (-90, 180) phase correction in t1 should be made.  
   
        H1 frequency on H2O (4.7ppm), 
        except for PM spin-lock during which tof is shifted to tofPM (~8ppm)
            
        N15 frequency on the amide region (~120ppm).  
             
        During the C13 double filter, C13 frequency is on the aliphatic region (35ppm),
        then is shifted to 116ppm for decoupling amide N from Calfa/C=O during t1.
