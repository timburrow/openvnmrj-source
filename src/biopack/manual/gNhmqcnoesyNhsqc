 gNhmqcnoesyNhsqc

DESCRIPTION and INSTRUCTION:

    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiment:
    4D NN HMQC-NOESY-HSQC
    ni(t1) --> 1H (Amide protons)
    ni2(t2)--> 15N
    ni3(t3)--> 15N

    OFFSET POSITION:
        tof =   ~4.75 ppm (1H on water).
        tofhn =  ~8 ppm  (center of amide protons).
        dof =   56 ppm (13Ca).
        dof2 =  120 ppm (15N region).

    CHOICE OF FLAGS:
    mag_flg = y -> Using magic angle gradients (Triax PFG probe is required).
    flipback = y -> Water flipback is used.

    C13 Decoupling during evolution:  use Pbox to make waveform for alpha and C=O decoupling 
                                      set dmm='cpcc' or 'cppc' or 'ccpc' or 'cccc'
                                      set dseq to name of Pbox-generated shape
                                      set dpwr to Pbox-generated dpwr 
                                      set dmf to Pbox-generated dmf 
                                      set dres to Pbox-generated dres 
                                      use dm='nynn' or 'nyyn' for decoupling during t2
                                      use dm='nnyn' or 'nyyn' for decoupling during t3
