  For tests of 2H decoupling using channel 3 or 4 
  *******************************************************
  
  SAMPLE: Normal sample (typically D2O in H2O). The same sample as used
          in the AutoCalibrate may be used.

  Results (power, offset, and dmf) are stored in the probefile and are 
  accessed when using an experiment setup macro so that decoupling
  parameters are set properly automatically, derived from the
  automatic calibration of 2H pw90 using that channel.
