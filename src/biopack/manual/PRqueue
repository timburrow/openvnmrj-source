 
Automated Projection Reconstruction Experiment Queuing
******************************************************

Automated PR data collection is available in BioPack for queuing multiple 
PR experiments. Control is accessed by selecting  "Proj.Reconstr."  in the 
column at the left of the displayed page controlled by the "Acquire" folder 
in VnmrJ . This is the principal tool used for setting up and executing a 
series of different PR pulse sequence experiments and includes the option 
of automatic optimization and selection of projection angles. 

How to Run a PR Series 
**********************

Once a sample is ready for acquisition, a 1D ghn_co spectrum 
should be obtained with good S/N, adequate to show all NH's. The spectrum 
should be phased, referenced and then expanded to show the NH region only. 
The phase settings and display settings will be used for analysis of data 
from the PR experiments.

Select the "Proj.Recontstr." page in the "Aquire" Folder.
(At this point the parameters in the current experiment are irrelevant
except for the sp/wp and rp/lp values). All experiment control is done
via the "Proj.Reconstr." page. At first use, or for any experiment
in the list that has not been yet set up with parameters, the entry
boxes are empty. They will be filled when the "Initialize" button is used, 
as indicated below).

Enter the number of PR experiments desired in the top entry box and then
their names in the "experiment" column, scrolling if more than 3 sequences 
are to be used. Make sure that the sequences entered (except for gNhsqc) 
have the Projection Reconstruction option (they have a "pra" parameter 
that is active). Do not enter any other parameters at this time. 
(The currently possible sequences using the "pra" variable are listed in the
dropdown menu  "Experiments...Protein Triple-Resonance..Projection Recon-
struction (TILT)". gNhsqc may be used as a 2D experiment as desired. The
displayed ni/sw/sw1 values are used as normal for gNhsqc. No tilted planes
are acquired when gNhsqc is in the experiment list (note that the entry
boxes are grey'd out for gNhsqc).

Set Options if desired (see below for details), particularly the relaxation
delay used for all experiments.

Enter the full pathname of the storage directory and the name of the
directory used for this series. 

Click the "NH Region Phased and Expanded" button to store NH region
display parameters into global variables. Click the "Initialize" button 
to populate the parameter settings.

Modify any of these values as desired at this time,
whether to collect F2F3 NH planes for each (as opposed to using data from 
gNhsqc or ghn_co)` and whether to have the software automatically select 
the NH region of the first experiment for the basis of analysis . The spectral 
widths in F1 and F2 for 13C and 15N should be matched to the actual 
spread of frequencies for these nuclei in order to have the highest 
possible resolution for the chosen ni, ni2 and niTilt. This will permit 
the most accurate analysis of peak positions (see below for details of
setting sw1 and sw2).

Click the "Show Time" button to obtain 
an estimate of the total time. This step also checks for too many 
increments in constant time experiments and will display output in the 
text window if the maximum number of increments is exceeded for any of 
the experiments, assuming that the pulse sequence code has been written 
to show these messages. (Note, if the Spectrometer Message button on 
the hardware toolbar turns red, it is likely that this has happened.) 

Note that the total time will be within a range depending on the need
for more projection planes than one. The Max # Proj. entry box allows
you to limit the total number in order to fit within the total time
available.

If this time is acceptable, click "Begin", otherwise adjust parameters 
to meet the requirements. The data will be stored in the specified 
storage directory. This directory will have subdirectories named for 
the sequences used. These subdirectories will have the stored fids and 
analysis output in the form of text files. While the experiments are 
running, histograms are displayed showing the optimum angle used for 
the next experiment for the best chance of resolving overlapped peaks.

It is possible to reset the PR variables for experiments still not run 
while acquisition is proceeding. However, the output file PRglobals will 
not reflect these changes. 

Setting the optimum sw1 in tilted experiments
*********************************************

The optimum setting for sw1 in tilted experiments is determined from 
the peak positions in the orthogonal planes. For instance, in HNCO 
spectra of ubiquitin the CO signals are found in the range between 
170.50 and 180.75 ppm. On a 600 MHz instrument this corresponds to a 
bandwidth of 1537.5 Hz. Likewise the N-15 chemical shifts range from 
102.42 to 132.94 ppm which corresponds to a bandwidth of 1831.2 Hz. 
Hence the maximum theoretically possible span of signals in tilted 
experiments is :

sqrt(1537.5*1537.5 + 1831.2*1831.2) = 2391.07 Hz

In practice the real bandwidth depends on the sample and is always 
smaller than the theoretically calculated value because we rarely 
(if ever) find cross-peaks in the corners of the 3D space. Therefore, 
the largest setting for the spectral width in the indirect dimension 
in this particular case is sw1 = 2400 Hz. 

In order to accommodate the displaced axial peaks (particularly the 
water signal) the sw1 setting needs to be somewhat wider than the 
chemical shift range. Hence practical settings for sw1 (CO) and 
sw2 (N15) are ~ 2000 Hz and 2200 Hz. There are two options for setting 
sw1 for the tilted planes. Setting the global variable PRvarsw1 (variable 
sw1 flag) to 'n' (using the "Auto sw1" checkbox) will always use displayed sw1 
value (PRsw1), which in the case of HNCO should be set to 2400 Hz (at 
600 MHz). If the "Auto sw1" checkbox is set (PRvarsw1 is set to 'y') 
the sw1 is recalculated depending on the displayed sw1, sw2 and  
projection angle values (PRsw1, PRsw2 and pra). This, however, may 
cause problems in constant time experiments because the preliminary 
check (see above) is done for pra=0 only. However, increasing an 
indirect dimension spectral width for fixed # increments usually will 
not cause an error.

Global BioPack PR parameters common to all pulse sequences
 (these are set by the entry/check boxes or menus in the
  Proj.Reconstr. panel)
**********************************************************

PRsp, PRwp - determines the spectral range that is used for PR processing. 
These parameters are set by the "NH Region Phased & Expanded" button.

PRrp, PRlp - stores user-determined rp and lp values for PR processing. 
These would normally be determined by first running a first increment 
gNhsqc or ghn_co, transforming, phasing and expanding to show the NH 
region containing peaks. Adequate S/N should be obtained for confident 
accounting of all NH's. PRsp and PRwp are derived from the resultant 
display. These parameters are set by clicking the "NH Region Phased & 
Expanded" button.

PRsetlim - y/n determines whether the display limits PRwp and PRsp are 
further optimized beyond on preliminary user defined values. This flag 
is only used once prior to the execution of the queue of PR experiments. 
It is set by the "Auto NH Region" checkbox.

PRskipF2 - allows the skipping acquisition of  the F2F3 (N-15) dimension. 
A value of 'y' means that the F2F3 (NH) plane of the first experiment, 
e.g. N-15 HSQC or HNCO, is used for analysis (peak picking) to produce 
a peak list for use in experiments for subsequent pulse sequences. This 
peak list is copied into the experiment subdirectories for use by the 
automatic angle prediction. The flag is set by the "Skip 15N F2F3 Planes" 
checkbox.

PRd1 - relaxation delay used for all PR experiments. Its value is set in 
the "Proj.Reconstr." page.

PRnexp - number of PR pulse sequences to be used in the PR queue. Its 
value is set in the "Proj.Reconstr." page.

Global BioPack PR parameters specific to each pulse sequence
************************************************************

These global parameters contain settings for the corresponding variables 
in each of the pulse sequences used in the queue. They are arrayable 
parameters and they store the settings as arrays. For example, PR[5]npeaks 
would contain the value for the number of expected peaks for the fifth 
pulse sequence used. Their values are set in entry boxes, menus or in 
checkboxes in the "Proj.Reconstr." page.    

PRexp - pulse sequence name as stored in the active seqlib. This is 
entered in the "experiment" entry box.

PRnpeaks - approximate number of expected peaks in the spectrum. It 
is important to set this parameter to a reasonable number. If a large 
number of spurious (noise) peaks is picked up by the automatic routines, 
the calculation of the best projection angle may fail. This is 
selected via the "peaks" entry box. 

PRnpr - maximum number of tilted projections. Typically 2 to 3 for 
small proteins. The experiment may finish sooner if all PRnpeaks are 
found or if no new peaks are found. This is entered in the "Max # Proj." 
entry box

PRbpa - (y/r/n) determines whether to use optimized projection angles ('y') 
or to run the experiments with PRnpr regularly spaced ('r') tilt angles 
spanning 90 degrees. The third, option ('n') chooses the projection angles 
according to the sw1/sw2 ratio. 

PRpos - (y/n) determines whether to expect only positive peaks in the 
analysis. This helps to limit the number of spurious peaks in the peak 
lists and improves the prediction of the best projection angle. This is 
selected via the "Pos. Peaks" checkbox.

PRthr - the threshold (dynamic range) is used to reduce the number of 
spurious peaks in the peak lists and improves the prediction of the 
best projection angle. The expected values are between 0 and 1 with 
typical values ranging between 0 and 0.3. The PRthr value can be 
considered as the fraction of the average peak's height that is used 
to certify the acceptance of a peak as "real". The higher the value of 
PRthr, the fewer peaks that are found. For example, use 0.3 in N-15 HSQC 
of a small protein. This is entered in the "Thr." entry box.

PRvarsw1 - (y/n) variable sw1 flag. If set to 'y' the sw1 is recalculated 
for all tilted experiments from pra, PRsw1 and PRsw2 settings. Otherwise 
PRsw1 is used for all tilted experiments.

PRsw,  PRsw1,  PRsw2,  PRni, PRni2, PRnt, PRniTilt - These global 
parameters contain settings for the corresponding variables sw, sw1, 
sw2, ni, ni2 and nt in each of the pulse sequences used in the queue.  
These are entered in the relevant entry boxes. The value of PRniTilt 
is entered in the "niTilt" entry box. Its value determines the number 
of increments in the tilted plane experiments.

	Pulse sequences
The following BioPack sequences have the option for Projection 
Reconstruction  and have a 15N Semi-Constant-Time option - SCT = 'y':

ghn_co, ghn_coA, ghn_ca, ghn_caA, ghn_co_ca, ghn_co_caA, 
ghn_ca_co, ghn_ca_coA, gcbca_co_nh, gcbca_co_nhA, gcbca_nh, 
ghc_co_nh, ghc_co_nhA, ghn_cacb, ghn_cacbA.

This permits collection of much higher resolution data with more 
accurate peak picking and reduction of overlap.

Output files
************
A set of files is generated in the process of predicting the next best 
projection angle. These files are a by-product of the automation routine 
and are updated after each completed 2D plane. Hence, if the calculation 
needs to be repeated, the processing must be restarted from the beginning 
(F1 and F2). The final output file, PR.out contains some preliminary 
information about the peak positions found by the standard peak picking 
routine in the process of predicting the next best projection angle. Note 
that the standard peak picking routines often miss peaks that are closely 
overlapping. A more complete and accurate list can be generated following 
a full reconstruction of the nD spectra which, in general, requires fewer 
tilted experiments. Such reconstruction routines have been implemented in 
third party software (e.g. Olivia from Hokkaido University, PR-CALC, Duke 
University, and others) and a VnmrJ version is also on its way.  

The PR.out file contains the F3, F1 and F2 chemical shifts (in ppm), 
normalized peak intensity and number of hits (maximum is 4 - two in the 
orthogonal planes and two in any of the tilted planes).

The PR.list file is for internal use and contains the same information 
as the PR.out file, except the peak positions are in Hz with respect to 
the carrier frequency. The additional columns are internal scores, the 
projection angle used for this data set and peak positions in XX.pk lists.

The XX.pk lists are produced from the standard XX.ll peak lists generated 
by the ll2d command and contain the F2 peak positions in Hz relative to 
the carrier frequency, peak linewidth, the same for F1, the absolute peak 
intensities and some internal scoring.

The PR.more file contains additional information relative to that in PR.list. 
The columns show the peak intensities in F1, F2 and projections P1 and P2 
with respect to the average intensity in each corresponding dimension, the 
same intensities relative to F1, the frequency deviations in F3, F1 and F2, 
the H-1 linewidth and its variation in Hz and finally F1 and F2 linewidth 
in Hz. 
 
The PR.bpa file contains the number of projected peaks at projection angles 
spanning from 0 to 90 degrees. The data from both, positive and negative 
angles are added together. After this file is accessed to find the next 
projection angle it is renamed with an index appended, increasing with 
each new experiment.

The PRglobals file contains a record of all the PR global variable values 
present at the start of the experiment. 

The PRmessages file contains a record of all the output messages produced 
by the above macros. These same messages are displayed in the message 
window of VnmrJ.
