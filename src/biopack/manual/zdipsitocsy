 zdipsitocsy - zfiltered tocsy with dipsi2 spinlock 

        pw = 90 degree excitation pulse (at power tpwr)
    satdly = length of presaturation;
  strength = spinlock field strength in Hz
    satmode  = flag for presat control
               ('y' for during relaxation delay )
       wet   = flag for WET solvent suppression
     phase = 1,2: for HYPERCOMPLEX phase-sensitive F1 quadrature
     sspul = 'y':  hs-90-hs sequence initiates D1 delay
             'n':  normal D1 delay
       mix = mixing time  (can be arrayed)

           TRANSMITTER MUST BE POSITIONED AT SOLVENT FREQUENCY 
             this pulse sequence requires a T/R switch,
             linear amplifiers and computer-controlled attenuators on the
             observe channel.
