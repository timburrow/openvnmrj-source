    3D C13 edited noesy with separation via the carbon of the destination site
         recorded on a water sample  and bandselective decoupling during t2

                      NOTE dof MUST BE SET AT 110ppm ALWAYS
                      NOTE dof2 MUST BE SET AT 200ppm ALWAYS

    Set dm = 'nnny', [13C decoupling during acquisition].
    Set dm2 = 'nyny', [15N dec during t1 and acq] 

    Must set phase = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI
    acquisition in t1 [H]  and t2 [C].

    Set f1180 = 'y' and f2180 = 'y' for (-90,180) in F1 and (-90,180) in  F2.    
     
    dof is changed automatically to 85ppm. This folds aromatic carbons over.
    Set sw2=60ppm.
    dof2 is set to 200ppm (middle of aromatic N15 resonances).

    Use the VnmrJ button to run the macro BPrna_CCdec. This will create the 
    necessary waveforms and set their parameters (set all other parameters
    before doing this).

    For Carbon-Carbon filtering, run 2 experiments with the two different
    filters. Subtract data to obtain purine-pyrimidine separation.

    Always check the proper folding by running a quick CH plane by setting 
    ni=0,phase=1 and ni2=32,phase=1,2.
