  hacahbA  Autocalibrated version of original hacahb_cosy_500a.c

    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following
    experiment:

    3D C(alpha) - H(beta) - H(alpha) Correlation
 
    Uses three channels:
         1)  1H             - 4.73 ppm 
         2) 13C             - 46.0 ppm 
         3) 15N             - 119.0 ppm  

    Set dm = 'nny', dmm = 'ccp' [13C decoupling during acquisition].
    Set dm2 = 'nyn', dmm2 = 'cgc', or 'cpc'

    Must set phase = 1,2 for States-TPPI
    acquisition in t1 [13C,alpha].

    Must set phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI
    acquisition in t2 [1H,beta].
    
    The flag f2180 should be set to 'y' (-90,180) phase corrects  
    Set f1180 = n (0,0) phase corrects

    Note: When you run the f1-f3 plane you will see a "counter-
          diagonal" in the methyl (f3) region at 3* the slope
          of the diagonal. This is due to triple quantum magnetization
          of the methyl (3* the proton chemical shift).
