 Process Multiple Data Sets in Stored Fid Files 
**********************************************
  When this option is selected three entry boxes 
are visible, with numbers at the left. The numbers
refer to data set number, not Experiment (workspace)
numbers. If more that three data sets are specified
in the top line, a scroll bar is displayed that 
permits viewing/entry for up to BPpipenexp boxes
(BPpipenexp is specified by the entry box at the top).

The data present in the current experiment are not
used. If the data present in the current experiment are
to be used as part of the "Stored Data" option, the data
should first be saved using the BPsvf macro or the "Save
Fid Now" button in the Acquire/Future Actions panel, or on
one of the "Save File" pages and then the full path name
should be entered in one of the "Stored Data" entry boxes.

NMRpipe processing is initiated by the "Process These
(Muliple) Data Sets" button, using the options selected
at the left (except the Export function). For appropriate
data sets, strip plots can be generated automatically
using the "Process These Data Sets and Make Strip Plots"
button. NMRpipe processing scripts and files are stored
in the stored .fid files.

Results of processing of any selected data set may be viewed
in the current experiment by use of the menu function.
In this case, normal VnmrJ commands and panels would be used
to display the NMRpipe-processed data.
