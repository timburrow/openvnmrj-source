 ghca_nA

 Uses coherence selection and (optional) magic angle gradient pulses.

 3D hcan  correlates Ha, Ca and N15(i) and N15(i+1).

 (useful for proteins undergoing fast NH exchange)

    Uses three channels:
         1)  1H   (t3)       - carrier  4.7 ppm (tof)
         2) 13CA  (t2, ni2)  - carrier  56 ppm  (dof)
         3) 15N   (t1, ni)   - carrier  120 ppm (dof2) 

    gzcal = gcal for z gradient (gauss/dac),   
    mag_flg = y,  using magic angle pulsed field gradient
                   uses gzcal (= 0.0022 gauss/dac, for example)   
             =n,  using z-axis gradient only

   The waltz16 field strength is enterable (waltzB1).
   Typical values would be ~6-8ppm, (3500-5000 Hz at 600 MHz).
  
   The coherence-transfer gradients using power levels
   gzlvl1 and gzlvl2 may be either z or magic-angle gradients. For the
   latter, a proper /vnmr/imaging/gradtable entry must be present and
   syscoil must contain the value of this entry (name of gradtable). The
   amplitude of the gzlvl1 and gzlvl2 should be lower than for a z axis
   probe to have the x and y gradient levels within the 32k range. For
   any value, a dps display (using power display) shows the x,y and z
   dac values. These must be <=32k.

   The autocal and checkofs flags are generated automatically in Pbox_bio.h
   If these flags do not exist in the parameter set, they are automatically 
   set to 'y' - yes. In order to change their default values, create the flag(s) 
   in your parameter set and change them as required. 
   The available options for the checkofs flag are: 'y' (yes) and 'n' (no). 
   The offset (tof, dof, dof2 and dof3) checks can be switched off individually 
   by setting the corresponding argument to zero (0.0).
   For the autocal flag the available options are: 'y' (yes - by default), 
   'q' (quiet mode - suppress Pbox output), 'r' (read from file, no new shapes 
   are created), 's' (semi-automatic mode - allows access to user defined 
   parameters) and 'n' (no - use full manual setup, equivalent to the original 
   code).
