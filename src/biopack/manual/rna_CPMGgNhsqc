/*  rna_CPMGgNhsqc.c

    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiment:

    HSQC gradient sensitivity enhanced version for N15/H1 chemical shift
    correlation employing a CPMG pulse train instead of regular INEPT transfer
    for improved magnetization transfer of exchange broadened resonances.
    Optional C13 refocusing and editing spectral regions.


                      NOTE dof MUST BE SET AT 110ppm ALWAYS
                      NOTE dof2 MUST BE SET AT 200ppm ALWAYS


    pulse sequence: Mulder, F.A.A. et al, J. Biom. NMR, 8 (1996) 223-28.



                  CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

    Set dm = 'nny', dmm = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for C13 decoupling.
    Set dm2 = 'nny', dmm2 = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for N15 decoupling.

    Must set phase = 1,2  for States-TPPI acquisition in t1 [N15].

    The flag f1180 should be set to 'y' if t1 is to be started at halfdwell
    time. This will give -90, 180 phasing in f1. If it is set to 'n' the
    phasing should be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.  Thus,
    set f1180='n' for (0,0) in N15.  f1180='y' is ignored if ni=0.



                  DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF rna_CPMGgNhsqc


    1. Obtain a printout of the Philosopy behind the RnaPack development,
       and General Instructions using the macro:
                                      "printon man('RnaPack') printoff".
       These Detailed Instructions for rna_CPMGgNhsqc may be printed using:
                                      "printon man('rna_CPMGgNhsqc') printoff".

    2. Apply the setup macro "rna_CPMGgNhsqc".  This loads the relevant parameter set
       and also sets ni=0 and phase=1 ready for a 1D spectral check.

    3. Centre H1 frequency on H2O (4.7ppm), C13 frequency on 110ppm, and N15
       frequency on the aromatic N region (200 ppm).

    4. CPMG pulse train:
       ncyc should be set to multiple of 8 (8, 16 or 24).

    5. CHOICE OF N15 REGION:
       amino='y' gives a spectrum of amino resonances centered on dof=85ppm.
       This is a common usage.                               Set sw1 to 40ppm.

       imino='y' gives a spectrum of imino groups.  dof is shifted
       automatically by the pulse sequence code to 155ppm.  Set sw1 to 25ppm.

    6. Splitting of resonances in the N15 dimension by C13 coupling in C13
       enriched samples can be removed by setting C13refoc='y'.
