   CCLS: Carbonyl Carbon Label Selective
   For detection of 1H-15N units involved in 13C=O-15N linkages

    See "Carbonyl carbon label selective (CCLS) 1H-15N HSQC
    experiment for improved detection of backbone 13C-15N
    cross peaks in larger proteins", J. Biomol.NMR, 39, 177-185 (2007),
    Marco Tonelli, Larry R. Masterson, Klaas Hallenga, Gianiuigi Veglia
    and John Markley.

   CCLS experiment on selectively labeled samples (only CO labeled)
   set CCLS='y' to turn on suppression of NH attached to 13CO
   set CCLS='n' to collect regular spectrum
   timeCT=0.016 will give maximum suppression of HN-CO signals

   recommend running the experiment interleaved:
   CCLS='n','y'
   ni=64 phase=1,2 f1180=y

   wft2d(1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0, 0,0,0,0) will give reference spectrum CCLS='n'
   wft2d(0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0) will give CO suppressed spectrum CCLS='n'
   wft2d(1,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,-1,0) will give difference spectrum
					       (but S/N will be reduced)

   dof is set to CO region (174ppm)
