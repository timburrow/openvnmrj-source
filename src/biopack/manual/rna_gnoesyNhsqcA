  rna_gnoesyNhsqcA


    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiment:

    3D NOESY-HSQC gradient sensitivity enhanced version for 15N, with
    H1-H1 NOESY in the first dimension, and N15 shifts in the second.

    optional magic-angle coherence transfer gradients

    Standard features include optional 13C sech/tanh pulse on CO and Cab to 
    refocus 13C coupling during t1 and t2; one lobe sinc pulse to put H2O back 
    along z (the sinc one-lobe is significantly more selective than gaussian, 
    square, or seduce 90 pulses); preservation of H20 along z during t1 and the 
    relaxation delays; option of obtaining spectrum of only NH2 groups;

    Written by MRB, January 1998, starting with gNhsqc from BioPack.
    Revised and improved to a standard format by MRB, BKJ and GG for the 
    BioPack, January 1998, so as to include calculation of the above 
    standard features within the pulse sequence code and associated macro.

    modified from proteinpack/gnoesyNhsqc.c for RNA  GG 10/4/00 based
    on Peter Lukavsky version.


        	  CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

    Set dm = 'nnn', dmm = 'ccc'
    Set dm2 = 'nny', dmm2 = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for N15 decoupling.

    Must set phase = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI acquisition in
    t1 [H1]  and t2 [N15].
   
    The flag f1180/f2180 should be set to 'y' if t1/t2 is to be started at
    halfdwell time. This will give -90, 180 phasing in f1/f2. If it is set to
    'n' the phasing should be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.  Thus,
    set f1180='n' for (0,0) in H1 and f2180='n' for (0,0) in N15.  f1180='y' is
    ignored if ni=0, and f2180='y' is ignored if ni2=0.



          	  DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF gnoesyNhsqc

         
    1. Obtain a printout of the Philosopy behind the BioPack development,
       and General Instructions using the macro: 
                                      "printon man('BioPack') printoff".
       These Detailed Instructions for gnoesyNhsqc may be printed using:
                                      "printon man('gnoesyNhsqc') printoff".
             
    2. Apply the setup macro "gnoesyNhsqc".  This loads the relevant parameter
       set and also sets ni=0 and phase=1 ready for a 1D spectral check.

    3. Centre H1 frequency on H2O (4.7ppm), C13 frequency on 110ppm, and N15 
       frequency at 200 ppm.

    4. Pulse and frequency calibrations are as for gNhsqc, or as generally
       used for BioPack.

    6. Splitting of resonances in the 1st or 2nd dimension by C13 coupling in 
       C13-enriched samples can be removed by setting C13refoc='y'.

    7. H2O preservation is achieved according to Kay et al, except that a sinc
       one-lobe selective pulse is used to put H2O back along z.  This is much
       more selective than a hard, Seduce1, or gaussian pulse.  H2O is cycled
       back to z as much as possible during t1 and t2.

    8. NH2 GROUPS: (set amino='y')
       A spectrum of NH2 groups, with NH groups cancelled, can be obtained
       with flag NH2only='y'.  This utilises a 1/2J (J=94Hz) period of NH 
       J-coupling evolution added to t1 which cancels NH resonances and 
       inverts NH2 resonances (normal INEPT behaviour).  A 180 degree phase
       shift is added to a N15 90 pulse to provide positive NH2 signals.  The 
       NH2 resonances will be smaller (say 80%) than when NH2only='n'.

   SETETUP: dof2 is changed automatically
        imino='y'
        -IMINO-REGION:  sw=22ppm
                        sw1=22ppm
                        sw2=25ppm (folds aminos)
                        dof=110ppm
                        dof2=155ppm
        amino='y'
        -AMINO-HMQC:    sw=22ppm
                        sw1=22ppm
                        sw2=60ppm (folds iminos)
                        dof=110ppm
                        dof2=85ppm

        dof is set to 110 ppm (middle of C13 resonances).
        Always check the proper folding by running a quick NH plane by setting
        ni=0,phase=1 and ni2=32,phase=1,2.
