 rna_cchtocsy_CCdec

    3D (H)CCH-TOCSY utilizing SE or watergate.

    Correlates ribose 13C resonances of a given ribonucleotide.
    Uses isotropic 13C mixing

    added C2' 13C homonuclear decoupling during 
    t2 evolution period to help with resolution (KD) 

    mixing time = 25-30ms (35 ppm rf field)
          Set sw=5ppm.
          Set sw1=36ppm.
          Set sw2=18ppm
