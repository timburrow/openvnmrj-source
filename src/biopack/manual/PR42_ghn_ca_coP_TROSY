  PR42_ghn_ca_coP_TROSY
 
    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following
    experiment:

    4D projection-reconstruction hncaco with deuterium decoupling
	F1 	C-alpha
	F2 	CO
	F3 	N + JNH/2
	F-acq	HN- JNH/2

    This sequence uses the four channel configuration
         1)  1H             - carrier @ 4.7 ppm [H2O]
         2) 13C             - carrier @ 55 ppm (CA) and 176 ppm(Co)
         3) 15N             - carrier @ 118 ppm  
         4) 2H		    - carrier @ 4.5 ppm 

    Set dm = 'nnn', dmm = 'ccc' 
    Set dm2 = 'nnn', dmm2 = 'ccc' 

    Flags
	satmode		'y' for presaturation of H2O
	fscuba		'y' for apply scuba pulse after presaturation of H2O
        sel_flg         'y' for active suppression of the anti-TROSY peak
        sel_flg         'n' for relaxation suppression of the anti-TROSY peak

	Standard Settings
   satmode ='n',fscuba='n',mess_flg='n'

   Use ampmode statement = 'dddp'
   Note the final coherence transfer gradients have been split
   about the last 180 (H)

   Calibration of carbon pulses
	
    To set correct phasing in the CO dimension: Set angle_CO=0 and
    ni=1.  Array sphase until a null is achieved. The correct value for 
    sphase is then this value plus 45.

Modified on 11/20/03 by R. Venters to a projection reconstruction sequence.
Also added Cb decoupling during Ca-CO transfers and Ca evolution.
Modified on 10/07/04 by R. Venters to add tilt proper tilt angles.
