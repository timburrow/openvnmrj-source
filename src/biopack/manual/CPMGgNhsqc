  CPMGgNhsqc.c

    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiment:

    HSQC gradient sensitivity enhanced version for N15/H1 chemical shift
    correlation employing a CPMG pulse train instead of regular INEPT transfer
    for improved magnetization transfer of exchange broadened resonances.

    pulse sequence: Mulder, F.A.A. et al, J. Biom. NMR, 8 (1996) 223-28.



                  CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

    Set dm = 'nny', dmm = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for C13 decoupling.
    Set dm2 = 'nny', dmm2 = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for N15 decoupling.

    Must set phase = 1,2  for States-TPPI acquisition in t1 [N15].

    The flag f1180 should be set to 'y' if t1 is to be started at halfdwell
    time. This will give -90, 180 phasing in f1. If it is set to 'n' the
    phasing should be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.  Thus,
    set f1180='n' for (0,0) in N15.  f1180='y' is ignored if ni=0.



                  DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF CPMGgNhsqc


    1. Obtain a printout of the Philosopy behind the BioPack development,
       and General Instructions using the macro:
                                      "printon man('BioPack') printoff".
       These Detailed Instructions for CPMGgNhsqc may be printed using:
                                      "printon man('CPMGgNhsqc') printoff".

    2. Apply the setup macro "CPMGgNhsqc".  This loads the relevant parameter set
       and also sets ni=0 and phase=1 ready for a 1D spectral check.

    3. Centre H1 frequency on H2O (4.7ppm), C13 frequency on 110ppm, and N15
       frequency on the amide N region (120 ppm).

    4. CPMG pulse train:
       ncyc should be set to multiple of 8 (8, 16 or 24).
