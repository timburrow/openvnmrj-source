/*  rna_HNNcosy.c

    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiment:

    TROSY-type correlation of imino H-N frequencies to the adjacent
    J-correlated 15N nuclei (i.e. across the hydrogen-bond).


    pulse sequence: 	Dingley and Grzesiek, JACS, 120, 8293 (1998)
     

                        NOTE: dof must be set at 110ppm always
                        NOTE: dof2 must be set at 200ppm always

        	  CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

    Set dm = 'nnn', dmm = 'ccc'
    Set dm2 = 'nnn', dmm2 = 'ccc'

    Must set phase = 1,2  for States-TPPI acquisition in t1 [N15].
    
    The flag f1180 should be set to 'y' if t1 is to be started at halfdwell
    time. This will give -90, 180 phasing in f1. If it is set to 'n' the 
    phasing should be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.  Thus,
    set f1180='n' for (0,0) in N15.  f1180='y' is ignored if ni=0.
    f1coef='0 -1 0 1 0 -1 0 -1'.



          	  DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF rna_HNNcosy

         
    1. Obtain a printout of the Philosopy behind the RnaPack development,
       and General Instructions using the macro: 
                                      "printon man('RnaPack') printoff".
       These Detailed Instructions for rna_HNNcosy may be printed using:
                                      "printon man('rna_HNNcosy') printoff".
             
    2. Apply the setup macro "rna_HNNcosy".  This loads the relevant parameter set
       and also sets ni=0 and phase=1 ready for a 1D spectral check.

    3. Centre H1 frequency on H2O (4.7ppm), C13 frequency on 110ppm, and N15 
       frequency on the N-aromatic region (200ppm).
       The dof2-value will be shifted to 185ppm automatically by the sequence
       code; set sw1 to 100ppm.

    4. CALIBRATION OF pw AND pwN:
       Should be done in rna_gNhsqc.

    5. CALIBRATION OF dof2:  
       Should be done in rna_gNhsqc.

    6. Splitting of resonances in the N15 dimension by C13 coupling in C13
       enriched samples can be removed by setting C13refoc='y'.

    7. H2O preservation is achieved according to Kay et al, except that a sinc
       one-lobe selective pulse is used to put H2O back along z.  This is much
       more selective than a hard, Seduce1, or gaussian pulse.  H2O is cycled
       back to z as much as possible.

    8. The coherence-transfer gradients using power levels
       gzlvl1 and gzlvl2 may be either z or magic-angle gradients. For the
       latter, a proper /vnmr/imaging/gradtable entry must be present and
       syscoil must contain the value of this entry (name of gradtable). The
       amplitude of the gzlvl1 and gzlvl2 should be lower than for a z axis
       probe to have the x and y gradient levels within the 32k range. For
       any value, a dps display (using power display) shows the x,y and z
       dac values. These must be <=32k.

       If water suppression is not efficient or exchanging iminos are lost,
       optimize gzlvl1 and gzlvl2 by arraying them together. Take the best
       compromise between S/N for iminos and water suppression. Then optimize
       gzlvl2 in small steps for optimum signal (on a 500MHz INOVA, best results
       could be achieved with gzlvl1=10000 and gzlvl2=10090).

    9. 1/4J DELAY and timeT DELAY:
       These are determined from the NH coupling constant, JNH, listed in 
       dg for possible change by the user. lambda is the 1/4J time for H1 NH 
       coupling evolution. lambda is usually set a little lower than the
       theoretical time to minimize relaxation.
       timeT is the transfer time from N15 to N15 across hydrogen-bond.
       Usually set to 15-20ms.
