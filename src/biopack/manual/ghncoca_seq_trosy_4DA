 ghncoca_seq_trosy_4DA.c - auto-calibrated version of the original sequence

    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiment:

    4D hncoca with trosy
                       F1      CO(i-1)
                       F2      CA(i)
                       F3      15N + JNH/2
                       F4(acq) 1H (NH) - JNH/2

    This sequence uses the standard three channel configuration
         1)  1H             - carrier (tof) @ 4.7 ppm [H2O]
         2) 13C             - carrier (dof) @ 174 ppm [CO] 
         3) 15N             - carrier (dof2)@ 119 ppm [centre of amide 15N]  
    
    Set dm = 'nnn', dmm = 'ccc' 
    Set dm2 = 'nnn', dmm2 = 'ccc'

    Must set phase = 1,2 , phase2 = 1,2, and phase3 = 1,2 
    for States-TPPI acquisition in t1[Co], t2[Ca], and t3[N].
    [The fids must be manipulated (add/subtract) with 
    'grad_sort_nd' program (or equivalent) prior to regular processing.]
    
    Flags
        fsat            'y' for presaturation of H2O
        fscuba          'y' for apply scuba pulse after presaturation of H2O
        f1180           'y' for 180 deg linear phase correction in F1
                            otherwise 0 deg linear phase correction
        f2180           'y' for 180 deg linear phase coreection in F2
                            otherwise 0 deg
        sel_flg         'y' for active suppression of the anti-TROSY component
        sel_flg         'n' for relaxation suppression of the anti-TROSY component

	Standard Settings
        fsat='n',fscuba='n',f1180='y',f2180='y',f3180='n'

    
    Set f2180 to y for (-90,180) in Ca and f3180 to n for (0,0) in N
    Set the carbon carrier on the C' and use the waveform to pulse the
        c-alpha
