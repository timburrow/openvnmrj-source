 CNHSQC-NOE-CNHSQC4D  
     Time-shared (TS), up to 4D:

15N/13C-HSQC(t3,ni3) --> H-H  NOE (t2,ni2) --> hnTROSY/CHseHSQC (t1,ni; acq)

	in 3D/4D form this provides following NOE correlation:
        HN  <-> HN
        H3C <-> H3C
	HN   -> H3C
        H3C  -> HN

 Sample is assumed to be all deuterated+12C, except 13CH3-IVLMAT,15NH.
 No care taken for N-CA, N-CO, C-C [de]coupling, no ZQ filters during NOE

    
    2012 CORRECTIONS FOR INOVA-TYPE APDELAYS ARE IN, NOT TESTED 
    2012 DECOUPLING OF 15N FROM CA/CO IS NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED

    
    swN - spectral width in 15N
    swC - spectral width in 13C
    sw2 - spectral width in 1H (NOE) dimension. 
    Folding recommended, sw2=6ppm seems to good.

    pwC, pwN, pw, pwClvl, pwNlvl, tpwr etc - standard BioPack Parameters

    Coherence selection gradients:

	15N encoded by (gzlvl4+gzlvl5)*gt4, decoded by gzlvl6*gt6
	13C encoded by (gzlvl4-gzlvl5)*gt4, decoded by gzlvl6*gt6
     
	coherence selection optimization:

     1. array gzlvl4 +/- 10% of the default value, maximize HN signals

     2. array gzlvl4, gzlvl5  around found vaules, keeping gzlvl5+gzlvl4
        constant,NH signals should stay unchanged, maximize CH3 signals

   Decoupling from CO/CA [NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED AS OF MAY 2012] decCACO='y'


   Experiment type: exp_mode setting

   '2D' - Time-Shared (TS) 15N TROSY/ 13C seHSQC
   '3D' - NOESY(t2)-(TS 15N TROSY/ 13C seHSQC, t1)
   '4D'- (TS 15N/13C HSQC, t3)-NOESY(t2)-(TS 15N TROSY/ 13C seHSQC, t1)
   '4Da'-(TS 15N/13C HSQC, t3)-NOESY(t2)-(TS 15N TROSY/ 13C seHSQC, t1), 
	  phases phi5/phi7 are inverted so that (HN<->H3C) cross-peaks
          are of a opposite sign of H3C<->H3C and HN<->HN  peaks

   fourth character in the exp_mode determines whether NOE(t2) part is
   flanked by selective water pulses as in paper (default). A 45-degree
   shift is used in NOE(t2) for exp_mode='***t'

   to run a "full" 4D  version:
	set ni,ni2,ni3 accordingly, 
	phase=1,2 phase2=1,2 phase3=1,2 exp_mode='4D' or '4Da'
	array='phase,phase2,phase3,exp_mode'
			  												
  exp_mode='4x' - special case for test 3D version 
	(TS 15N/13C HSQC, t2)-NOESY-(TS 15N TROSY/ 13C seHSQC, t1)
	 set ni3=1, phase3=1 !!! 

   Phasing in direct dimension.

   In general, one will need to process CH and HN part of the
   spectra separately. There will be different phasing parameters fo
   CH3 and HN in direct dimension. However, phasing differences between
   HN and CH3 can be minimized by adjusting parameter ch90corr around
   default value.
	
   ch90corr defines how last 1H-methyl selective 90 degree pulse
   is aligned around last 90 pulse on 15N. ch90corr depends upon the
   shape used for that selective pulse and has value range between
   0.0 and 1.0, ch90corr=0.5 means that the ch90 selective
   pulse is centered around last 90 pulse on 15N.

   How to adjust ch90corr:
   1. acquire high-S/N 1D with default value of ch90corr. Phase the HN region.
   2. array ch90corr around default value with steps of 0.01,
      choose one that gives spectra properly phased on both HN and CH3 parts.

   Phasing in indirect dimensions.

   The pulse sequence flows as follows:

   15N/13C-H[S/M]QC(t3) --> H-H  NOE (t2) --> hnTROSY/CHseHSQC (t1, acq)

   (NOT IMPLEMENTED): set f1180='y' to start at half-dwell time in t1 direction
         (Time-shared 15N-TROSY /13C-seHSQC)

   set f2180='y' to start at half-dwell time in t2 direction (H-H NOE)
	 
   t3 is hard-coded to start at half-dwell time, in this dimension use
   90,-180 phase corrections and first-point multiplier = 1.0
