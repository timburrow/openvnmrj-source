    Uses three channels:
      1) HN (t3)       -  carrier 4.75 ppm (tof)
         HB (t1, ni)
      2) C13           -  carrier 46 ppm (dof)
      3) N15 (t2, ni2) -  carrier at 120 ppm (dof2)

    gzcal = 0.0022 gauss/dac,
    mag_flg  =  y  using magic angle pulsed field gradient
             =  n  using z-axis gradient only
    ref_flg  =  y  recording 2D HN-N reference spectrum in t2 dimension.
             =  n  recording 3D spectrum with N-HB coupling present.


     BioPack "H2Osinc.RF" shape(1418 steps)
     is used as default. Use pwHs=1418*n for no waveform
     error messages. Since only NH is detected, 1.418 msec is
     a reasonably selective pulse.
