   modified for 3rd Channel operation BKJ 970430 
   TROSY option is included. When TROSY is selected use nt=8 (NM, Palo Alto)
   
   Modified by Eriks Kupce :
   the TROSY phase cycle corrected to pick the correct component and to use the 
   sensitivity enhanced version. The minimum phase cycle for TROSY reduced to 4 steps.
   Corrected the d2 timing in the TROSY version. Added soft watergate option via
   wtg3919 flag.   
   
   Use f1coef = '1 0 -1 0 0 1 0 1' for TROSY
