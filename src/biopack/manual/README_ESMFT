The ESMFT 1.1

The following distribution is designed and tested on Vnmrj 2.1B
on Linux with installed BioPack Linux with installed BioPack. 
It could be also be used in older environments as VNMR and Solaris, 
in such a case, however, the panels would not be applicable (VNMR),
therefore macros should be executed from command line.
Executables (available from athors www site) should be recompiled (Solaris). 

FILE			DESCRIPTION
			
executables for Linux:  (for Solaris, contact authors below)
*********************

bin/timetab_gen	  generates table with coordinates of evolution time points

bin/view_tab      generates the gnuplot script file for plotting time points

bin/acqmod        creates new panel in "Acquisition" (not needed in BioPack)

bin/seqmod        modifies pulse sequence

bin/ToASTD_3D     transforms explicit sampling data using MFT

interface:
*********

templates/layout/default3dBP/Digital_Filter_BioPack.xml 

macros:
*******

maclib/BP_ESset  	defines all required parameters, modifies pulse
                        sequence and activates Explicit Sampling panel

maclib/BP_TABset	runs timetab_gen program with appropriate parameters

maclib/BP_PLOTset       plots the time points (requires GNUPLOT )

maclib/BP_MFTset	executes ToASTD_3D with appropriate parameters

maclib/BPsvf    	modified BPsvf macro (to store sampling parameters)
