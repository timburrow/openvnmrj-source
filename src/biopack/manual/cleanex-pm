        strength        - RF amplitude of the CLEANEX-PM sequence
        mix             - mixing time - the length of the CLEANEX-PM sequence
        gzlvlhs         - gradient power for the HS pulse during mix (< 1G/cm)

        alt_grd         - alternate gradient sign(s) on even transients
        gt1             - gradient duration for the solvent selection echo
        gzlvl1          - gradient power for the solvent selection echo
        dpfgse          - flag to select dpfgse water suppression

                                       (only used with dpfgse='y')
        wrefpwr         - power level for wrefshape (as given by Pbox)
                                       (only used with dpfgse='y')
        wrefpwrf        - fine power for wrefshape
                                by default it is 2048
                                       (only used with dpfgse='y')
        flipback    - flag for an optional selective 90 flipback pulse
                                on the solvent to keep it along z all time
        flipshape   - shape of the selective pulse for flipback='y'
        flippw      - pulse width of the selective pulse for flipback='y'
        flippwr     - power level of the selective pulse for flipback='y'
        flippwrf    - fine power for flipshape by default it is 2048
                        may need optimization with fixed flippw and flippwr
        phincr1     - small angle phase shift between the hard and the
                            selective pulse for flipback='y' (1 deg. steps)
                            to be optimized for best result
        gt2             - gradient duration for the solvent suppression echo
        gzlvl2          - gradient power for the solvent suppression echo
        gstab           - gradient stabilization delay
        wg3919          - flag for watergate 3-9-19 water supr. block
        d3              - delay in WATERGATE 3-9-19
        trim_flg        - flag for an optional trim pulse at the end of the
                                sequence to suppress protein background
        trim            - length of the trim pulse for trim_flg='y'
        trimpwr         - power level for trim if trim_flg='y'
        tof             - transmitter offset (set on resonance for H2O)
        compH           - amplifier compression factor for 1H

The water selection shape and the water refocusing and the water flipback shape can be
created/updatedted using the "update_wselshape", "update_wrefshape" and update_flipshape"
macros, respectively. For multiple frequency solvent suppression the wrefshape file needs
to be created manually.
