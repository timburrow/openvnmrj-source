  gcacb_tocsy_cmhmA.c               

    (H)CACB_TOCSY_CmHm utilizing gradients and double sensitivity enhancement.
    
    Uses optional magic-angle gradients.

    Correlates the sidechain aliphatic 13Ca and 13Cb resonances of a given 
    amino acid with methyl groups.

    Set dof to 13CO region.

    Uses isotropic 13C mixing.

    Use enough 13C decoupling to decouple all carbons, even though methyl
    protons are detected. This will minimize artifacts from other types 
    of carbons.

        	  CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

    	Set dm = 'nny', dmm = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for 13C decoupling.
	Set dm3 = 'nnn' for no 2H decoupling, or
		  'nyn'  and dmm3 = 'w' for 2H decoupling. 
  
    Must set phase = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI acquisition in
    t1 [1H]  and t2 [13C].

    2D experiment in t1: wft2d(1,0,-1,0,0,1,0,1) (sensitivity-enhanced)
    2D experiment in t2: wft2d('ni2',1,0,-1,0,0,-1,0,-1) (sensitivity-enhanced)
    ( or just use wft2da or wft2da('ni2') after setting
      f1coef='1 0 -1 0 0 1 0 1'
      f2coef='1 0 -1 0 0 -1 0 -1'
     for 3D just use ft3d )
    
    The flag f1180/f2180 should be set to 'y' if t1/t2 is to be started at
    halfdwell time. This will give 90, -180 phasing in f1/f2. If it is set to
    'n' the phasing should be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.  Thus,
    set f1180='n' for (0,0) in 13C and f2180='n' for (0,0) in 15N.  f1180='y' is
    ignored if ni=0, and f2180='y' is ignored if ni2=0.

     If 2H decoupling is used, the 2H lock signal may become unstable because
     of 2H saturation.  Check that a 1D spectrum is stable/reproducible as 
     when 2H decoupling is not used.  You might also check this for d2 and d3
     equal to values achieved at say 75% of their maximum.  Remember to return
     d2=d3=0 before starting a 2D/3D experiment.
