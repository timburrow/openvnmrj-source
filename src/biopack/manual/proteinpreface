                 BioPack Automatic Calibration
********************************************************************
        This procedure calibrates 1H, 13C and 15N pw90s, amplifier
        compressions and coherence-transfer gradients for 13C and 15N

        The optimum repetition rate is determined using an 15N
        gradient HSQC experiment.

        Small-angle phase corrections are determined for use
        in several experiments.

        Five radiation-damping optimized flipback shapes are calibrated.

        All calibration data are stored in the AutoTripRes
        directory and the probefile calibrations are updated.

        First-increment (ni=0, ni2=0) fids are collected and
        the data are stored in the AutoTripRes directory and
        the spectra are plotted. The number of transients is
        adjusted such that the hnco data set has s:n>20. All
        triple-resonance data sets are then acquired with this
        number of transients.
