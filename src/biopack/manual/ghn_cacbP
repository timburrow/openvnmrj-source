  ghn_cacbP.c

    3D HNCACB gradient sensitivity enhanced version.


    Correlates Ca(i) and Cb(i) with N(i), NH(i), and N(i+1), NH(i+1).  Uses
    constant time evolution for the 15N shifts.

    Standard features include maintaining the 13C carrier in the Cab region
    throughout using off-res SLP pulses; square pulses on Cab with first
    null at 13CO; one lobe sinc pulses on 13CO with first null at Ca; one lobe
    sinc pulse to put H2O back along z (the sinc one-lobe is significantly more
    selective than gaussian, square, or seduce 90 pulses); optional 2H 
    decoupling when CaCb magnetization is transverse for 4 channel 
    spectrometers.  

    Magic-angle option for coherence transfer gradients.  TROSY option for
    N15/H1 evolution/detection.

        	  CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

    	Set dm = 'nnn', dmm = 'ccc' 
    	Set dm2 = 'nny', dmm2 = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for 15N decoupling.
	Set dm3 = 'nnn' for no 2H decoupling, or
		  'nyn'  and dmm3 = 'cwc' for 2H decoupling.

    Must set = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI acquisition in
    t1 [13C]  and t2 [15N].

    The flag f1180/f2180 should be set to 'y' if t1/t2 is to be started at
    halfdwell time. This will give -90, 180 phasing in f1/f2. If it is set to
    'n' the phasing should be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.  Thus,
    set f1180='n' for (0,0) in 13C and f2180='n' for (0,0) in 15N.  f1180='y' is
    ignored if ni=0, and f2180='y' is ignored if ni2=0.



          	  DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF ghn_cacbP
                    

    1. Obtain a printout of the Philosopy behind the BioPack development,
       and General Instructions using the macro: 
                                      "printon man('BioPack') printoff".
       These Detailed Instructions for ghn_cacbP may be printed using:
                                      "printon man('ghn_cacbP') printoff".
             
    2. Apply the setup macro "ghn_cacbP".  This loads the relevant parameter set
       and also sets ni=ni2=0 and phase=phase2=1 ready for a 1D spectral check.
       At the middle of the t1 period, the 180 degree pulses on CO and 15N are
       swapped to a 180 degree pulse on Ca, for the first increment of t1, to
       refocus Ca chemical-shift evolution ensuring a zero first-order phase
       correction in F1. This is also the case for the 1D spectral check, or
       for 2D/15N spectra, when ni=0.

   3.  The delay tauCC is set to 0.6 ms for 1D spectra or for 2D/15N spectra
       to provide a large positive signal. The normal value for 2D/13C or 3D 
       nmr is 0.0035 (3.5 ms) which yields Ca and Cb signals of opposite sign.
       These approximately cancel in the 1D spectrum (see JMR B101, 201 for an 
       explanation).  tauCC is automatically reset to the value in the dg2 
       parameter set (normally 3.5 ms) for 2D/13C and 3D work (ie when ni>1).  

    4. Center H1 frequency on H2O (4.7ppm), C13 on 174ppm, and N15 frequency
       on the amide region (120ppm). The C13 frequency is calculated in the
       sequence to be at 46ppm, ie at Cab throughout the sequence.

    5. The normal 13C 180 degree pulse on CO at the middle of t1 induces a
       phase shift, which should be field-invariant, and so this phase shift has
       been calibrated and compensated in the pulse sequence. This phase shift
       can be checked by setting ni=1 whereby a special 1D method is invoked
       in which both the 13C CO 180 degree pulse and the simultaneous 15N 180
       degree pulse are applied just as for all t1 times other than t1=0.  First
       eliminate the CO pulse with (ni=1 pwS=0) and obtain a 1D spectrum. This
       spectrum will have reduced intensity compared to ni=0 because of 13Ca
       chemical-shift evolution during the time of the 180 pulses. If the
       phase shift is adequately compensated, a second very similar 1D spectrum
       will be obtained with pwS=180.  Unlike ghn_co and ghn_ca, the most 
       sensitive comparison of the two spectra with pwS=0,180 is obtained
       with phase=1 rather than phase=2.  If not adequately compensated, the
       first increment will be out of phase with all succeeding increments and a
       zero-order phase-shift will be necessary in F1, which is easily done
       after the 2D/3D transform. Alternatively, change the calibration by
       changing the phshift parameter in the INITIALIZE VARIABLES section of
       the code.  NOTE THAT dof MUST BE ACCURATELY CALIBRATED (to 1ppm) BEFORE
       THE phshift CALIBRATION. S/N can also be maximized by arraying compC
       when (ni=1 pwS=180).

    6. H2O preservation is achieved according to Kay et al, except that a sinc
       one-lobe selective pulse is used to put H2O back along z.  This is much
       more selective than a hard, Seduce1, or gaussian pulse.  WALTZ16 1H
       decoupling strength is determined by the parameter waltzB1.  
       The value is specified in the 
       new shapelib file after go or dps.  

    7. Another difference from the work of Kay et al is that the phases of the
       first and last Cab 90 degree pulses are alternated to eliminate artifacts
       from the CO 180 degree pulse.
 
    8. tauCC (3.5 ms) and timeTN (12.5 ms, determined for alphalytic 
       protease) and are listed in dg2 for possible readjustment by the user.

    9. TROSY:
       Set TROSY='y' and dm2='nnn' for a TROSY spectrum of the bottom right
       peak of the 2D coupled NH quartet (high-field H1, low-field N15).  The 
       TROSY spectrum gives 50% S/N compared to the decoupled spectrum for a 
       small peptide.  To select any of the other three peaks of the 2D coupled
       quartet, in a clockwise direction from bottom right, change t4/t10
       from x/y to x/-y to -x/-y to -x/y.  NOTE, the phases of the SE train
       are almost the same as those determined for the gNhsqc sequence.  The
       major difference is that kappa is eliminated compared to normal
       ghn_cacbP so the N15 magnetization has not evolved with respect to the 
       attached H's.  I.e. the N15 state would be Ix rather than IySz if there 
       was no coherence gradient - this imparts a 90 degree shift so t8 is 
       changed to y (from x in the normal spectrum).  Also gzlvl1 is after the
       180 N15 pulse rather than before as in gNhsqc, so the sign of icosel 
       and the t4/t10 phase2 increments are also swapped compared to gNhsqc.
       For ghn_c... type sequences, H1 decoupling during the first timeTN is
       replaced by a pi pulse at kappa/2 to reduce S/N loss for large molecules
       during the first TN period.  For these sequences H2O flipback is 
       achieved with two sinc one-lobe pulses, an additional one just before
       the SE train, similar to gNhsqc.

  10.  The N15 t2 evolution and the sensitivity enhancement train is common
       to all ghn_... sequences and the pulse sequence code for these final
       sections is in the include file, bionmr.h.
