 gh_ca_con

 Uses coherence selection and (optional) magic angle gradient pulses.

 Correlates Ha(i), CO(i) and N(i+1).
 Ref: Mäntylahti et al. J. Biomol. NMR, 47, 171-181 (2010).

    Uses three channels:
         1)  1H   (t3)       - carrier  4.7 ppm (tof)
         2) 13CO  (t2, ni2)   - carrier  174 ppm
            13Ca             - carrier  56 ppm (dof)
         3) 15N   (t1, ni)   - carrier  120 ppm (dof2)

    gzcal = gcal for z gradient (gauss/dac),   
    mag_flg = y,  using magic angle pulsed field gradient
                   uses gzcal (= 0.0022 gauss/dac, for example)   
             =n,  using z-axis gradient only

    The waltz16 field strength is enterable (waltzB1).
    Typical values would be ~6-8ppm, (3500-5000 Hz at 600 MHz).
  
       The coherence-transfer gradients using power levels
       gzlvl6 and gzlvl9 may be either z or magic-angle gradients. For the
       latter, a proper /vnmr/imaging/gradtable entry must be present and
       syscoil must contain the value of this entry (name of gradtable). The
       amplitude of the gzlvl6 and gzlvl9 should be lower than for a z axis
       probe to have the x and y gradient levels within the 32k range. For
       any value, a dps display (using power display) shows the x,y and z
       dac values. These must be <=32k.
