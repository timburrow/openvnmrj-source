   sequence:

   HMQC-TOCSY:

   status   : A|--------------B-----------------|C-|---D----|-E-
     1H     :   90-1/2J-        180        -1/2J-t2-spinlock-Acq (t3)
    13C     :           90-t1/2-   -t1/2-90     -BB-         -BB
  phtable   :   t1      t2      t6       t6           t3      t4 or t5    

   Parameters:

         d2 = First evolution time
         d3 = second evolution time
        mix = TOCSY mixing time
     pwClvl = power level for X pulses
     pwC    = 90 degree X pulse
     JCH   = X-H coupling constant
     dpwr   = power level for X decoupling
     tpwr   = power level for H pulses
     pw     = 90 degree H hard pulse
     slpwr  = power level for spinlock
     slpw   = 90 degree H pulse for mlev17
     trim   = trim pulse preceeding mlev17
     phase  = 1,2: gives HYPERCOMPLEX (t1) acquisition;
     ni     = number of t1 increments
     phase2 = 1,2: gives HYPERCOMPLEX (t2) acquisition;
     ni2    = number of t2 increments
     wet    = 'y':  wet option for H2O-sample (D2O is better!!!)
    wdwfctr = multiplication "window" factor of slpw
    hmqcflg = 'n': turns off HMQC part of the sequence

	NOTE dof MUST BE SET AT 110ppm ALWAYS

	Best to use with D2O-sample!!
        Decoupling: dm='nyy'
	Use with HCP or HCN probe: all couplings (15N-1H/13C or 31P-H1/13C) 
	with ribose nuclei are < ~10Hz
	Second decoupler (13P or 15N) not necessary: dm2='nnn' (dm2='nny' optional)
        sw1(13C)=50ppm and sw2(1H)=sw or smaller
