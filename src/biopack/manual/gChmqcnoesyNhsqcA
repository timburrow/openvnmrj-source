    gChmqcnoesyNhsqcA.c

DESCRIPTION and INSTRUCTION:

    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiment:
    4D CN HMQC-NOESY-HSQC
    ni(t1) -->  1H
    ni2(t2)--> 13C
    ni3(t3)--> 15N

    OFFSET POSITION:
        tof =   ~4.75 ppm (1H on water).
        tofh =  ~3 ppm  (center of aliphatic protons).
        dof =   35 ppm (Center of aliphatic carbon).
        dofcaco = 120 ppm (Center of Ca and CO).
        dof2 =  120 ppm (15N region).

    CHOICE OF FLAGS:
    mag_flg = y -> Using magic angle gradients (Triax PFG probe is required).

  PARAMETERS RELATED TO 13C DECOUPLING:
   the shape codec.DEC is created by the setupwurst macro in BioPack.
   the proper decoupling parameters for codec.DEC are obtained by the setwurstparams macro.
   and stored in dmm,dpwr,dmf,dseq and dres. Use dm='nyn' for CO decoupling in t2.

       CA/CO decoupling in t3 is achieved with a stC200 pulse
