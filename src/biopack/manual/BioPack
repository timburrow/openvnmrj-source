       The PHILOSOPHY for the development of BioPack

BioPack includes a parcel of commonly-used triple resonance (or quadruple
resonance if 2H decoupling is used) 3D pulse sequences for isotopically
labelled high resolution protein and polynucleotide NMR.

The protein pulse sequences are predominantly those developed by the Bax and
Kay groups. The sequence codes have been rewritten in a common format most
often from the Varian codes written by Kay and co-workers.

The RNA pulse sequences are predominantly those developed by the Puglisi, Bax,
Pardi and Kay groups.

The basic philosophy was to reduce the number of calibrations necessary to run
each sequence, to a minimum. This goal has been achieved in that only six
major parameters need to be calibrated for all the pulse sequences to function
well.

Three major parameters need to be calibrated for each spectrometer - frequency
offsets, tof, dof and dof2 for 1H, 13C and 15N (and dof3 for optional 2H
decoupling). Three major parameters are required for each probe - the 90 pulse
lengths for 1H (pw), 13C (pwC) and 15N (pwN) at chosen power levels (and dmf3
/dpwr3 for optional 2H decoupling).

Optimization of the 13C pulses is obtained by calibration of the 13C amplifier
compression via the parameter, compC. This seventh parameter should only need
to be calibrated once for each spectrometer at the maximum power level used
for 13C pulses, pwClvl. Similar compH and compN values are determined to 
permit accurate calculation of 1H and 15N power levels for decoupling, spinlocks
and flipback pulses.

A series of shaped and/or frequency shifted pulses are calculated by the
macro, "BPcal", and stored in your user shapelib. No input parameters
are required by the user to run this macro. It creates all shapes.
Decoupling files are calculated by the macros "BPsetupshapes" and "BPmakeSTUDpp".
All of these are done as part of the automatic calibration or probefile
update processes.

All other calibrations are automatically calculated from the above parameters
within the pulse sequence code.

With the above calibrations it is expected that each sequence will function
at,or near, optimum levels. Gains of a further few percent may be obtained by
tweaking the three 90 degree pulse times (especially pw and pwC) by up to 10%
to maximize S/N in a 1D spectral check. (This may be done using the automated
functions available by menu). 

			GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS

1. Calibrate 90 degree pulse lengths for 1H (pw), 13C (pwC) and 15N (pwN) at
   the chosen power levels, tpwr, pwClvl and pwNlvl respectively using a
   standard method of your choice. Recalibration of these pulse lengths as in
   point 9 may give a few percent gain in S/N. These power levels should be
   those for normal "hard pulse" experiments (not band-selective). Power
   levels for these pulses are typically chosen to be as short as possible
   without arcing. 

   In general, you should use the AutoCalibration feature
   on a dilabelled protein (~1mM in H2O) accessible via the menus (6.1) or
   buttons (VNMRJ in the Setup/Calibrations Page).

2. You should check, at least once, the C13 amplifier compression.

   Automatic Method (preferred):
   Use automatic calibration menu/button.

   Manual Method:
   At a particular pwClvl (eg 60) and dpwrf=4095, measure the C13 90 - this is pwC
   of course. Repeat this measurement at dpwrf=2047. Do not decouple during
   acq. A compression factor, "compC" is then determined by the relation:

   compC = (C13pw90 @ dpwrf=2047&pwClvl) / (2.0 * C13pw90 at dpwrf=4095&pwClvl)

   If compC is less than 0.95 serious loss of S/N may occur because the
   amplitudes of the soft C13 pulses will not be accurately calibrated.
   Either reduce pwClvl until compC > 0.95, or set the value of the compC
   parameter provided to this compression factor. The default is compC=1.0.
   As an example, in one test, setting compC=0.85 as determined above reduced
   the loss in S/N from 30% to 3%. If compC > 0.95, a small advantage may
   result in setting compC to the measured value.

3. The SLP pulses (shifted laminar pulses - pulses shifted off- resonance) and
   other shaped pulses will have been calculated using the macro
   "BPcal". These pulses are stored in your shapelib and automatically
   called by the pulse sequence code. This calculation takes into account the
   spectrometer frequency (eg 400 or 800 MHz), and it only needs to be done
   once for each system. The calculated lengths of the SLP pulses (pwC3, pwC4,
   pwC5 etc) used in each sequence are displayed by dg2 to provide confidence
   to the user that everything has been set up properly - do not change these
   since these SLP pulse lengths are determined only by dfrq and do not depend
   on pwC. All other pulse powers and pulse lengths are automatically
   calculated within the pulse sequence code from pw, pwC, pwN, compC,
   associated power levels, and the lengths of pwC3, pwC4 etcas determined by
   the macro, and these calculations take into account the spectrometer
   frequency. BioNMR and automatic Pbox versions (*P.c and *A.c) sequences use
   Pbox "on-the-fly" to calcluate pulse shapes, powers and widths, derived from
   pwC/pwClvl/compC.

4. Protein parameters have 1H frequency (tof) on H2O (4.7ppm), and the 15N frequency 
   (dof2) on the amide region (120 ppm). The C13 frequency (dof) will 
   be centered in the aliphatic region(46 or 35 ppm),Ca region (56 ppm) or the 
   CO region (174 ppm) as specified in the detailed instructions for each 
   pulse sequence. If optional H2 decoupling is used, set dof3 to the 
   center of the 2H aliphatic spectrum (ie 2.5 ppm). These frequencies are
   automatically obtained from the probefile and the experiment setup macro
   and any changes from the probefile value for specific experiments are handled
   in the experiment setup macro (see the macro "ghn_ca", for example)

5. The individual pulse sequence macros, eg "gc_co_nh", load the parameter
   sets for that sequence, set ni=ni2=0 and phase=phase2=1 ready for a 1D
   spectral check.

6. Most gradient levels and durations require no adjustment. The coherence
   pathway gradients, gzlvl1 and gzlvl2, should be adjusted for maximum signal
   in a 1D spectrum. Set gzlvl1 (eg 13000) and vary gzlvl2 by up to 2% or so
   around this number. Typical values are 13000/13080 + or -100 with the
   duration gt1=0.0025. This pair will be common to all BioPack sequences
   except for a small change for ghcch_tocsy (hcch_tocsy does not use
   coherence gradients).  The suppressed
   water signal echos during signal acquisition, and this echo may be
   minimised by trial-and-error adjustment of gzlvl5 and gzlvl6 which should
   not be equal. Set ssfilter=0 to observe maximum H2O signal. If magic-angle
   coherence transfer gradients are used, the gzlvl2 value may be
   significantly different and in the opposite direction from gzlvl1.

7. All echo times within each sequence have been adjusted to provide maximum
   signal for the protein alphalytic protease. For simplicity, only the most
   major delays are displayed and may be readjusted by the user. All other
   echo times are not under parameter adjustment, but can be changed within
   the sequence code. They are listed in the DECLARE AND LOAD VARIABLES
   section of each pulse sequence code as for example, zeta=0.0033 (ie delay
   zeta is 3.3 ms).

   To change a delay, simply edit the number and recompile the sequence.
   Alternatively, change zeta=0.0033 for example to zeta=getval("d4"),
   recompile the sequence, maximize 1D signals with an array of d4, and then
   re-edit as zeta=newnumber and recompile. Alternatively, edit as
   zeta=getval("zeta"), recompile the sequence, create the parameter in your
   parameter set using the command "create('zeta','delay')", and (optionally)
   list zeta in printed parameters using the command "paramvi('ap').

8. Deuterium decoupling is optional for spectrometers having 4 channels and
   may be applied, whilst CaCb magnetization is transverse, and during any 1H
   shift evolution, for all BioPack sequences except ghn_co (which does not
   generate transverse CaCb magnetization).  Set dm3='nyn' to invoke 2H
   decoupling and show the associated parameters in dg2. Adjust dof3, dpwr3,
   dmf3 in the usual way.  The 2H magnetization is preserved in all sequences
   except hcch_tocsy and ghcch_tocsy. In the latter cases disturbance of the
   lock signal may be observed. In sequences where preservation of 2H
   magnetization is achieved, trim gradients around refocusing pulses are
   switched off during the 2H decoupling, so additional artifacts are
   possible.

   Note that 2H decoupling is done via dm3='nyn'. No status(B) statement is
   present in the pulse sequences but dm3 is just used as a flag to call the
   setstatus statement. All the normal decoupling paramters such as
   dpwr3,dof3,dmm3,dmf3 etc. are active, however, and should be set properly.
   The 2H Decoupling Accessory should be used to couple in Channel 4 and the
   Lock to the lock circuitry of the probe.  The parameter "ampmode" should be
   set to 'dddp' when 2H decoupling is used with a BB 4th channel. If a
   lock/decoupler is used, ampmode='dddd'.  This parameter is present and is
   set by the macro BPsetampmode for all parameter sets having 2H decoupling
   as an option.

   When dm3='nyn', the macro "dg2" will show channel 4 parameters.  Otherwise
   no channel 4 parameters are visible.

Automatic Calibrations:
***********************

Fully-automatic calibrations are available via the menus or buttons. This
should be done upon installation of BioPack. You can manually change the
probefile entries, as well.

Running One Experiment:
**********************

After all calibrations have been calibrated/updated for your spectrometer, to
run an experiment just use the proper menu button (6.1) or select from the
drop-down menu (VNMRJ), or enter a macro command specifying the name of the pulse
sequence, e.g. rna_gNhmqc. This will recall the stored parameter set from
parlib, update calibrations, and runs the manual file.  Just set the values of
ni, ni2, phase, phase2 and nt and enter "go". 


Automatic 1D Spectra without Full Calibrations:
*****************************************

A set of 1D experiments may be automatically acquired by selecting the
"Setup/Proteins/Standard Experiments/....Auto1D.../Auto1D Options" buttons.
You will have options for using calibrations stored in the Probefile, or 
tpwr/pw values in the current parameter set (if you have already calibrated
1H on your sample). You also have the option of having the 1H pw90 calibrated
on the current sample first before doing the Auto1D. In this case, the
Probefile is updated after the calibration so that subsequent experiments
are setup accurately. This is a much faster way of doing a "screening" run
if only a sample has been changed following a full autocalibration. Here, only
the 1H pw90 is likely to change, yet the Auto1D plots can give useful
information as to sensitivity for the pulse sequences employed. The Auto1D
run is also much faster, permitting rapid "screening" of a new sample.

Automatic 2D Spectra without Calibrations:
*****************************************

A full set of 2D experiments may be automatically acquired by selecting the
"Auto2Dacquire" button in the CHECK menu. This requires that the above
calibration run be performed first, for proper parameter values. The number or
transients per fid is enterable. If nt=16 and d1=1 the experiments will take
about 11 hours. The are options for automatic processing and plotting of the
2D data. The Auto2Dproc/plot feature 
performs full processing, including automatic choice of linear prediction and
weighting functions, display and plotting for all data sets acquired using the
Auto2Dacquire button. Similar buttons are also available to process/plot only
amino or imino indirect detection 2D experiments for RNA/DNA. These buttons
produce plots containing both contour and stacked data.

***********************************************************************************


Offsets for RNA and DNA
***********************

The spectral widths provided are adequate for 600 MHz so they can be scaled to
your sfrq. The value of dof2 should be 200 ppm for all experiments.
All dof values are 110ppm. These are changed appropriately in the
psglib code for the specific pulse sequences. The automatic probefile update
using the "Update" button will store all calibrations based on the
tof,dof,dof2 and dof3 values present in the active rna_gChsqc parameter set.
Estimated tof and dof values will be approximately correct if calculated on
the basis of 5ppm being at tof=0 and 100ppm being at dof=0. These approximate
settings are usually sufficient for initial setup. Subsequently, you can reset
the tof and dof values in the parameter tables to those appropriate for your
spectrometer, or you can modify your /vnmr/nuctables entry to change your
spectrometer frequency to make tof=0 and dof=0 give 5 and 100 ppm (see System
Operation Manual, Chapter 14-"System Administration", section 14.8: "Modifying
the Nucleus Tables"). To do this you will have to determine from standard
samples with known chemical shifts how many hertz to change the values in your
nucleus table.

It is not necessary to use an RNA or DNA sample for AutoCalibration. A
dilabeled protein sample can be used. RNA
and DNA sequences use the same parameters as used by the protein experiments. Only
spectral widths and offsets are different and these are handled by the experiment
setup macros.

MENUS (VNMR 6.1)
****************

The standard VNMR "setup" menu is modified to call the BioPack menu. This
modified menu is placed in your vnmrsys/menulib (an existing file of this name
is backed out in vnmrsys/BioPack.dir/backups).

The BioPack menu gives the option of probefile update by selecting "Update"
button.

The BioPack menu gives buttons to access experiments, automatic 1D and 2D
runs, and a calibration option. Experiment buttons run the relevant simple
macro to call a parameter set.


2H Decoupling (requires 4 channels or Lock/Decoupler)
*****************************************************

Calibration
***********
Direct:
******

BioPack offers automatic calibration of the 2H pw90 and dmf3/dpwr3 values for
a 1kHz decoupling field strength. This is done on any protein sample or RNA/DNA
sample or even a D2O sample. This is done via the menu buttons(VNMR 6.1) or
by buttons in the Calibrations Page of the Setup/Calibrations panel (VNMRJ).

The experiment involves having tn='lk' and pulsing on the 2H channel. The 
automatic calibration varys the 2H pulse on the 2H channel and determines
the proper power and pulse width. Since this channel is the one doing 2H
decoupling via the same hardware and signal path, it is possible to calculate
the dpwr3 value for a 1kHz decoupling field. These results are stored in the
probefile and are accessed by experiment setup macros.

Because this method only works using channel 1 (tn=lk) and BB amplifier #1 without
recabling, the user must move one cable to use this method. Instructions are 
available via the menus or buttons, and are also described in the pulse sequence
code and manual entries.

Indirect:
********

A pulse sequence (*ddec_pwxcal.c) is supplied that can be used on a C6D6 or
CDCl3 sample. Example data are stored in the Protein fidlib. Cable the probe
for C13 observe and connect the channel 4 output to the 2H Decoupling
Accessory (coupler box). Connect the lock cable normally connected to the
probe to the same box, and connect the box to the probe at the lock BNC. Use
the 2H reject filter and low-pass filter at the BB preamp.

Use the menu buttons(VNMR 6.1) or dropdown menu(VNMRJ) for parameters. Adjust the
C13 pw to the value of a 90 degree pulse and any other appropriate parameters.
The C6D6 or CDCl3 triplet exhibits a nulling with increasing pw(2H), but the
outer lines null at a longer time than the inner lines. Use the outer lines to
find a null and this occurs at pw90(2H).  Use this value to determine dmf3
(dmf3=1e6/pw90) at the power dpwr3.

The parameter set *ddec_s2pul.par uses the pulse sequence *ddec_s2pul.c
(s2pul.c with amplifier unblanking and lock sample/hold for channel 4's amp).
You can verify the proper dof3 value by adjusting the dof3 array values so
that the results are symmetric with respect to dof3. This means that the
center value of dof3 corresponds to ~7ppm in the 2H spectrum. The dpwr3 and
corresponding dmf3 should be large enough to cover +-4ppm 
experiments, with dof3 set at 3ppm in the 2H spectrum. (It is not necessary to
decouple over the full 10ppm range since 2H decoupling is usually used to
decouple only aliphatic deuterons).

You can then check the efficiency by duplicating the experiment stored in the
Protein fidlib, ddec_s2pul.fid with your values of dpwr3,dmf3 and dof3.

In any of the triple-resonance parameter sets, entering dm3='nyn' activates
the channel 4 parameters listed in dg2 . The parameter sets in vnmrsys/parlib
should be updated using the "Install" menu button, or at any later time by
using the "Update" button, updating the channel 4 parameters.
In the future, just enter dm3='nyn' for 2H decoupling.
No change in parameters should be necessary from sample to
sample.

2H broadband decoupling is handled internally within the pulse sequences by
the "setstatus" psg command, not by the usual "status" approach. Thus, "dps"
and "pps" show only status A and C. The dm3 parameter is only used to
determine that decoupling is desired during relevant portions of the pulse
sequence and is requested by setting dm3='nyn'. Use of the normal status
approach will result in other channels being reset to their status values,
since all channels are set at the same time by any change in status on any
channel. Hence, C13 decoupling that is initiated by waveform generator psg
commands (decprgon) at an earlier time would be turned off since dm='n' when
there would be a normal status change on any other channel.

******************************************************************************

f1coef and f2coef values have been entered within the parameter sets when
needed. Use standard VNMR macros ft1da, ft2da, wft1da, wft2da and ft3d for
processing. These use f1coef and f2coef values (if present). Otherwise, they
use standard States processing. The sequences gChsqc and rna_gChsqc has different
requirements, depending on the values of SE,CT and ZZ.  Consult manual entry
for proper value of f1coef. If you use the tcl/tk checkboxes to select the
method, the value of f1coef is installed properly and wft2da can be used
without entering an f1coef value.)

The spectra should be phased up absorptive in the detected dimension. 2D
transforms should have lp1 and lp2 close to zero.

hcch_tocsy and rna_hcch_tocsy are pure States and have f1coef=f2coef=''. CH 2D spectra show
TOCSY CC transfer since d3 (t2) is prior to the TOCSY transfer.

*ghcch_tocsy is doubly-sensivity-enhanced and uses both f1coef and f2coef.
CH 2D data do not show CC tocsy transfer (unlike hcch_tocsy) since the d3 (t2)
evolution occurs after the spinlock. A full 3D spectrum will show all
crosspeaks

*gChsqc has a sensitivity-enhanced option. Use f1coef='1 0 -1 0 0 -1 0 -1'
when SE and f1coef='1 0 -1 0 0 1 0 1' when SE/CT.

        All of these can be run at any field strength after just calibrating
        the 90's for 1H, 13C and 15N. All power levels are automatically set
        for proper excitation. 2H decoupling is often available as an option
        by setting dm3='nyn' (and setting proper values for channel 4
        decoupling parameters). Operation is valid only for UNITYplus and
        UNITY INOVA.

        All Rf events including pulses, spinlocks and decoupling are auto-
        matically created for all field strengths by autocalibrate/autoupdate
        for all sequences. Power levels for each of these are then set by the
        pulse sequence itself, not the operator, based on the high-power pw,
        pwC and pwN calibrations.

        All experiments in which CH protons are the relevant originating
        magnetizations or are the detected magnetization can be skipped for
        the case of fully-deuterated proteins (for automatic calibration or
        automatic 2D).

        Two alternative methods of using phase-ramped pulses is included.
        These methods call Pbox for shape creation at the time of "dps" and
        "go". No shapes are required in shapelib for this method. These
        sequences have a "P" or "A" appended to the normal names. The former
        must be compiled the "bionmr.h" include file, while the latter require
        the "Pbox_bio.h" and "Pbox_psg.h" include files.

        The "P" versions use new psg elements which are written with protein
        13C bandwidths pre-defined so that terms such as "ca", "co" and "cacb"
        are used. See rthe file "BioPack.bionmr" in "~/vnmrsys/manual" or in
        "/vnmr/manual/" for details. The operation, parameters and performance
        of these is at least as good as the standard BioPack sequences. The
        only differences are that the phi7cal value will be different, and
        that the "dof" value is always set to the carbonyl carbon frequency
        for all experiments (contributed by Boban John, Varian, and Robin
        Bendall)

        The "A" versions include a header section of the pulse sequence in
        which all shapes are created and parameter values from these shapes
        are obtained at "go" time. This mode of operation allows conversion of
        existing pulse sequences to BioPack versions without modification of
        the underlying codes (contributed by Eriks Kupce, Varian, Sept. 2002).
        See the file "BioPack.Asequences" in "~/vnmrsys/manual" or in
        "/vnmr/manual" for details on this approach, and how to convert an
        existing non-BioPack sequence to a BioPack version.

        For the system administrator, AutoCalibration/Update processes will
        update parameter sets and shaped pulses in "/vnmr". Any other user can
        then run BioPack using these calibrated data from "/vnmr"; if such
        users run AutoCalibration/Update, calibrated parameters and updated
        pulse shapes and "*.DEC" pattern will be stored in the user's
        "vnmrsys/shapelib".

        For VnmrJ:  Probefile updates, AutoCalibrations, Auto1D and Auto2D
        procedures are handled via the "Calibrations" page in the Setup folder.
        experiment pages. Similar capabilities are in the "BioPack Options"
        page in the "rna_gChsqc" pages.

        Chempack compatibility: the main VNMR menu has been modified to have
        either one or two buttons for setup depending on the presence of
        Chempack and/or BioPack (through the macros "dg2CP" and "dg2BP").
        If only BioPack was installed ("dg2CP" present) the setup button will
        call the menu "setupbp". If only Chempack was installed ("dg2BP"
        present) the setup button will call the menu "setupcp". If both are
        installed, two buttons will appear. If both packages are installed,
        the menu "main2" (Main Menu -> More) shows 2 buttons to change Tcl-dg
        for Chempack or BioPack (need to exit and restart VNMR to activate
        the change).
