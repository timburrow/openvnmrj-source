Description of BioPack Options in "Calibrations" Page


AutoCalibrate Buttons:
**********************

When using a 13C,15N-labeled compound:

 "Full, Using Probefile Values"
   This button begins a fully automated calibration of all important
   parameters for doing Biomolecular NMR experiments. It should be 
   used after installation of BioPack so that all parameters will be
   properly calibrated and values stored in the probefile. Many
   parameters such as gradient levels and small-angle phase shifts
   are calibrated in this process. These do not change as a function
   of sample, so the "Full" autocalibrate does not need to be done
   for each sample. In addition to calibrations, first-increment
   spectra are obtained for a wide variety of experiments and these
   spectra are displayed and plotted in a side-by-side manner to
   permit easy comparison of "receptivity" for the sample used.
   A copy of the probefile is also printed.

   One important operation that is included for any of these buttons
   is the automatic update of the probefile and the automatic re- 
   generation of all shaped pulse files and waveforms used for 
   spinlocks and decoupling. 

 "Full, But use Current 1H Offset and pw"
   This button does the same as that described above, but uses the
   tpwr and pw values in the current experiment as starting guesses.
   It is useful if the user has calibrated the 1H pw90 manually.

 "Full RF (Faster)"
   This button will use the same experiments as above, but will stop 
   after the RF and NH gradient coherence transfer calibrations. It can
   be used once the "Full" calibration is performed and is often
   preferred because of the shorter time required.

 "RF and Gradients (Fastest)"
   This button will use similar experiments as above, but will not
   do amplifier compression determinations or flipback pulse calibrations. 
   Use of this assumes a reasonably calibrated probefile and is used for a
   quick check of the most important parameters, pw90's and gradients.

 "1H pw90 only"
   This button will use the similar experiments as above, but will only
   do 1H pw90 and related calibrations. This may result in a slightly
   different value than that obtained by using a single pulse because
   the pulse sequence used here involves multiple 90's and 180's. This
   results in a more appropriate value for Biomolecular NMR experiments.

For a 13C-labeled Compound:

 "1H and 13C PW90 only"
   This button will use the same experiments as above, but will only
   do 1H/13C pw90 and related calibrations. 

For a 15N-labeled Compound:

 "1H and 15N PW90 only"
   This button will use the same experiments as above, but will only
   do 1H/15N pw90 and related calibrations. 

  In all cases data are stored in ~/vnmrsys/AutoTripRes. New runs
  cause the existing directory to be moved to ~/vnmrsys/BioPack.dir/backups
  with a date stamp appended.


Calibrate 2H Decoupling Buttons
*******************************

 "Channel#"
  This button initiates a fully automatic calibration of the channel
  used for 2H decoupling. The proper button should be used for your
  hardware configuration. The experiments involve pulses derived from
  the 2H decoupling channel, with observe in the tn=lk mode so that
  the observe channel detects 2H signals via the lock diplexer,not the
  normal broadband preamp. This ensures that the RF path is the same
  as that used for 2H decoupling. Thus, the 2H decouplng channel should
  be connected to the proper relay in the "magnet leg" or "front end".
 
  After the 2H pw90 and power level are determined, the probefile is 
  updated with proper power and dmf values for broadband decoupling of
  2H from 13C. Experiment setup macros use these probefile values to
  install proper numbers so that 2H decoupling is typically called for
  by setting dm3='nyn'(for sequences having internally coded 2H decoupling
  portions).

 "Instructions"
  This button produces an instruction manual which is displayable by
  selecting the "Text Out" page.

Flipback Pulses
***************

 "Calibrate/Create"
  This button performs the flipback(selective pw90 on H2O) pulse calibration
  on the H2O in the sample. These are optimized for power and phase and
  new shaped pulses "H2Osinc_*" are created for specific use in several
  pulse sequences. Any H2O sample can be used, but this process is normally 
  done in the above experiments.

Automated Triple-Resonance Experiments:
**************************************

Auto 1D:

 "Standard"
  This button skips the calibration parts of the "Full,.." buttons above,but
  does the first increment spectra for comparison purposes. It takes much
  less time and can be used when changing samples or adjusting conditions for
  the same sample (pH, temperature, etc.).

 "First Calibrate 1H"
  This button does the same as "Standard",but first calibrates the 1H pw90 (and
  updates the probefile). This is useful if the probe tuning changes or the
  salinity of the sample is changed, but all other aspects are the same. 

 "Use this tpwr/pw"
  This button does the same as "Standard",but uses the 1H pw90 in the
  current parameter set. This is useful if the user has manually calibrated
  the sample.

  In all Auto 1D cases data are stored in ~/vnmrsys/AutoTripRes1D. New runs
  cause the existing directory to be moved to ~/vnmrsys/BioPack.dir/backups
  with a date stamp appended.

Auto 2D:

 "Auto2D (# hours)"
  This button runs a series of 2D experiments using both 2D and 3D pulse
  sequences. It relies on a calibrated probefile. Fixed numbers of increments
  are used for a screening mode. The relaxation delay is adjusted so that
  all experiments will finish within # hours. Data is stored in the user's
  vnmrsys/AutoTripRes2D

 "Fully-Deuterated Check Box"
  This check box should be checked if the sample is per-deuterated. This 
  results in CH-detected 2D's being skipped.

Auto BEST 2D:

  This button runs a series of BEST (fast) 2D experiments using both 2D and
  3D sequences. It relies on a calibrated probefile. Fixed numbers of increments
  are used for a screening mode. The relaxation delay is typically short
  from 10-300msec. By default, 100msec is used. The acquisition time is also
  dropped in half from normal experiments because of the higher decoupling
  duty cycle. The macro that begins the experiments is BPauto2dBEST(optional
  relaxation delay, optional halving "at"). Data is stored in the user's
  vnmrsys/Auto2DBEST directory.

 "Do Automatic Proc/Plot of 2D (at end)"
  This check box causes automatic processing and plotting of the 2D
  experiments at the end of the the Auto2D process. If checked, the
  BEST experiments plot at the end of every experiment. 

 "Do it Now" (4,8 or 16 hour experiments)
  This button performs the same automatic proc/plot as above, but can be
  done once the experiments have finished.

 "Plot Auto Best Now"
  This button performs the same automatic proc/plot as above, but can be
  done once the BEST experiments have finished.

Plotting Mode:

  "No Plots"
  No plotted output of AutoCalibration data is produced. However, raw data 
  is still archived in ~/vnmrsys/AutoTripRes.

  "Plots"
  Spectra are plotted as the experiments complete in the AutoCalibration 
  process. Data is archived in ~/vnmrsys/AutoTripRes.
