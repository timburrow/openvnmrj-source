  For tests of 2H decoupling using a normal BB channel or Lock/Decoupler:
  ******************************************************************
  
  SAMPLE: Normal sample (typically D2O in H2O). The same sample as used
          in the AutoCalibrate may be used.

  HARDWARE REQUIRED: 2H Automation Relay 
    (gives ability to 2H gradient shim or obs 2H via lock coil/diplexer)

  PROCEDURE:

  You must move the 2H Decoupler cable for this test to run properly.

  This is done by moving the cable carrying the 2H decoupler channel rf from
  the top to bottom position of relay K5022. This relay is mounted at the 
  back of the magnet leg and can be viewed without opening the door. It is
  the leftmost relay when looking directly at the back.
 
  Leave the cable normally attached to the bottom of relay K5022 unattached.
 
  No prior knowledge of power, offset or dmf is required.

  Results (power, offset, and dmf) are stored in the probefile and are 
  accessed when using an experiment setup macro or menu button.

  REMEMBER:  recable both cables for normal operation
                 (2H observe with tn=lk, or 2H
                  decoupling using the relevant channel)
