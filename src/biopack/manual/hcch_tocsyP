  hcch_tocsyP.c               

    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following
    experiment:

    3D HCCH-TOCSY utilising gradients but not coherence gradients.


    Correlates the sidechain aliphatic 13C resonances of a given amino acid.
    Uses isotropic 13C mixing.

    Standard features include maintaining the 13C carrier in the CaCb region
    throughout using off-res SLP pulses; full power square pulses on 13C 
    initially when 13CO excitation is irrelevant; square pulses on the Ca and
    CaCb with first null at 13CO; one lobe sinc pulses on 13CO with first null
    at Ca; optional 2H decoupling when CaCb magnetization is transverse and 
    during 1H shift evolution for 4 channel spectrometers.

    Derived from gc_co_nh.c written by Robin Bendall, Varian, March 94 and 95
    based on hcchtocsy_3c_pfg_500.c written by Lewis Kay, Sept and Dec 92.  
    Revised and improved to a standard format by MRB, BKJ and GG for the 
    BioPack, January 1997. Increased and scaled spinlock field (GG).

    CC spinlock now called from decspinlock statement, permitting waveforms
    from shapelib. Pbox macros can prepare the waveform, allowing adiabatic
    decoupling for good bandwidth with reduced sample heating. E.Kupce sep01
    Added to BioPack, G.Gray sep01.

    Efficient STUD+ decoupling is invoked with STUD='y' without need to 
    set any parameters.
    (STUD+ decoupling- Bendall & Skinner, JMR, A124, 474 (1997) )

     
    STUD DECOUPLING.   SET STUD='y':
       Setting the flag STUD='y' overrides the decoupling parameters listed in
       dg2 and applies STUD+ decoupling instead.  In consequence is is easy
       to swap between the decoupling scheme you have been using to STUD+ for
       an easy comparison.  The STUD+ waveforms are calculated for your field
       strength at the time of BioPack installation and RF power is 
       calculated within the pulse sequence.  The calculations are for the most 
       peaks being greater than 90% of ideal. If you wish to compare different 
       decoupling schemes, the power level used for STUD+ can be obtained from 
       dps - subtract 3dB from that level to compare to decoupling schemes at
       a continuous RF level such as GARP.  The value of 90% has
       been set to limit sample heating as much as possible.  If you wish to 
       change STUD parameters, for example to increase the quality of decoupling
       (and RF heating) change the 95% level for the centerband
       by changing the relevant number in the macro makeSTUDpp and 
       rerun the macro (don't use 100% !!).  (At the time of writing STUD has
       been coded to use the coarse attenuator, because the fine attenuator
       is not presently included in the fail-safe calculation of decoupling 
       power which aborts an experiment if the power is too high - this may
       lower STUD efficiency a little).


        	  CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

    	Set dm = 'nny', dmm = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for 13C decoupling.
	Set dm3 = 'nnn' for no 2H decoupling, or
		  'nyn'  and dmm3 = 'cwc' for 2H decoupling. 
  
    Must set phase = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI acquisition in
    t1 [1H]  and t2 [13C].
    
    The flag f1180/f2180 should be set to 'y' if t1 is to be started at
    halfdwell time. This will give -90, 180 phasing in f1/f2. If it is set to
    'n' the phasing should be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.  Thus,
    set f1180 = 'n' for (0,0) in 1H and f2180 = 'n' for (0,0) in 13C.





          	  DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF hcch_tocsyP


    1. Obtain a printout of the Philosopy behind the BioPack development,
       and General Instructions using the macro: 
                                      "printon man('BioPack') printoff".
       These Detailed Instructions for hcch_tocsyP may be printed using:
                                      "printon man('hcch_tocsyP') printoff".
             
    2. Apply the setup macro "hcch_tocsyP".  This loads the relevant parameter
       set and also sets ni=ni2=0 and phase=phase2=1 ready for a 1D spectral
       check. 

      
    3. Sufficient bandwidth is needed to cover the aliphatic region (50 ppm =
       10 kHz on 800 MHz spectrometers) and adequate for the CC J's.  The
       pulse sequence "hcch_tocsy.c" uses a "hard-coded" DIPSI-3 (constant
       amplitude modulation) with no parameter input except for the number
       of cycles. This version (hcch_tocsyP) uses the decspinlock function. 
       
       Parameters:
        ncyc(typ 2-3), spinlock(e.g. 9000 at 600 MHz), mixpwr, mixpwrf, mixpat, mixdmf, mixres

        If Pbox is used to create the waveform, the *DEC file contains the
        values to be used for these parameters. The BioPack macro
        "setupwurst" creates one specific "cctocsy.DEC" file based on the
        values of pwC/pwClvl/compC. This macro also is run during the 
        AutoCalibration Process. The macro "setwurstparams" runs also, and
        it gets values from the "cctocsy.DEC" for the above parameters and
        updates the hcch_tocsyP.par appropriately. Thus, using the             
        "hcch_tocsyP" macro or button/menu entry will return a parameter set
        ready to go.
          
      
    4. Centre H1 frequency on H2O (4.7ppm), C13 frequency on 35ppm, and N15 
       frequency on the amide region (120 ppm).  The C13 frequency remains at 
       35ppm, ie in the center of the aliphatic region throughout the sequence.

    5. The flag H2Opurge = 'y' is provided to bring H2O and other H1 z 
       magnetization to the xy plane for gradient suppression.

    6. taua (1.7 ms), taub (0.42 ms) and tauc (1 ms) were determined for
       alphalytic protease and are listed in dg2 for possible readjustment by
       the user.

    7. If 2H decoupling is used, the 2H lock signal may become unstable because
       of 2H saturation.  Check that a 1D spectrum is stable/reproducible as 
       when 2H decoupling is not used.  You might also check this for d2 and d3
       equal to values achieved at say 75% of their maximum.  Remember to return
       d2=d3=0 before starting a 2D/3D experiment.
