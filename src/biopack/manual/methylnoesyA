  methylnoesyA - auto-calibrated version of the original sequence
                           methyl_3d_noesy_500.c
   
    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following
    experiment:

    3D C(methyl-CT) -  noesy - C(methyl-CT) - H (methyl)
 
    Uses three channels:
         1)  1H             - 4.73 ppm 
         2) 13C             - 19.6 ppm 
         3) 15N             - 120.0 ppm  

    Set dm = 'nny',  [13C decoupling during acquisition].
    Set dm2 = 'nnn'

    F1: 13C methyl 
    F2: 13C methyl 
    F3: 1H  methyl 

    carbon carrier is set to 19.6 ppm

    If CT_flg[A] == 'n' then the t1 period is CT and t2 is not
    If CT_flg[A] == 'y' then the t1 period is CT and t2 is CT

    Modified by L.E.K on Feb. 18, 98 to include CT option 


    Based on Val_4d_noesy_600.c

    Modified by L.E.K on March 26, 1998 to include simultaneous 15N acquistion
    during T2. Set n_shift == 'y' and be sure to include 15N decoupling during
    acquisition. Reduce the decoupling power since both 15N and 13C decoupling
    is present. 

    If CT_flg == 'n' then  make sure t1,max is < about 9.5ms; Note that c-c and
    N-ca evolution will proceed (if n_shift == 'y')

    At 600 MHz use a 1.2 ms iburp2 centered at 54.5 ppm to invert the Ca. Use
    a (600/y)*1.2 ms iburp2 at a field strength of y MHz.
