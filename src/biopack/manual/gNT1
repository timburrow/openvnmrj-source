 gNT1     Heteronuclear T1 with TROSY option

	written by Youlin Xia, HKUST on Jan. 20, 1999.
	
	The pulse sequence is used to measure T1 of 15N.
	
Note:   
        
1       Tdelay should be even times of 2.0*delta, here delta=2.5ms.
         
2       Shapedpulse shape_ss is used to 
        invert NH resonance,not disturbing H2O. Its shape is produced by
        the proteincal macro at installation of BioPack as cosine-
        modulated pulse with 180's +-4ppm from H2O. The pw_shpss is
        calculated by the setup macro "gNT1" to match the stored shape.
        Its power ,shss_pwr, is calculated in the 
        pulse sequence. 
        
3       Set ncyc > 0 (even number) to vary 15N T1 relaxation period (approximately
        ncyc*5ms).

        Note: ncyc should be even

4.      Flipback pulses are calculated and if tpwrsf<4095 the log attenuator is
        increased by 6db and the fine attenuator is set around 2048. This fine
        power can then be varied to correct for the effects of radiation damping.

5.      Watergate is used for solvent suppression during the last spin-echo.
