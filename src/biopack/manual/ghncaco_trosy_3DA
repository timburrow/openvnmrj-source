  ghncaco_trosy_3DA.c - auto-calibrated version of the original sequence
 
    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following
    experiment:

    3D hncaco with deuterium decoupling
	F1 	CO
	F2 	N + JNH/2
	F-acq	HN- JNH/2

    This sequence uses the four channel configuration
         1)  1H             - carrier @ 4.7 ppm [H2O]
         2) 13C             - carrier @ 56 ppm (CA) and 174 ppm(Co)
         3) 15N             - carrier @ 120 ppm  
         4) 2H		    - carrier @ 4.5 ppm 

    Set dm = 'nnn', dmm = 'ccc' 
    Set dm2 = 'nnn', dmm2 = 'ccc' 

    Must set phase = 1,2, phase2=1,2 for States-TPPI
    acquisition in t1[CO] and t2 [N]. [The fids must be manipulated
    (add/subtract) with 'grad_sort_nd' program (or equivalent) before regular
    processing for non-VNMR processing.]
    
    Flags
	fsat		'y' for presaturation of H2O
	fscuba		'y' for apply scuba pulse after presaturation of H2O
	f1180		'y' for 180 deg linear phase correction in F1 
		        	otherwise 0 deg linear phase correction
	f2180		'y' for 180 deg linear phase correction in F2
			    otherwise 0 deg linear phase correction
	fc180   	'y' for CO refocusing in t1
        sel_flg         'y' for active suppression of the anti-TROSY peak
        sel_flg         'n' for relaxation suppression of the anti-TROSY peak
        cacb_dec        'y' decoupling of cb during transfer from Ca to CO
        nietl_flg       'y' for active suppression of the anti-trosy with 
                            no loss in s/n
                        (D.Nietlispach,J.Biomol.NMR, 31,161(2005))

	Standard Settings
   fsat='n',fscuba='n',mess_flg='n',f1180='y',f2180='n',fc180='n'

   Use ampmode statement = 'dddp'
   Note the final coherence transfer gradients have been split
   about the last 180 (H)

   Calibration of carbon pulses
	
        pwc90     delta/sqrt(15) selective pulse applied at d_c90
        pwca180   delta/sqrt(3) selective pulse applied at d_c180
        pwca180dec pwca180+pad
        pwcareb   reburp 180 pulse (about 300 us at 600MHz) applied at d_creb
	pwcosed    delta/sqrt(3) pulse applied at d_sed
                 USE delta/sqrt(3) and not seduce pulse

   Calibration of small angle phase shift (set ni=1, ni2=1 phase=1,
   phase2=1)
     sphase  set fc180='y' and change sphase until get a null(no signal).
                The right sphase is the value at the null plus 45 degrees

     sphase1 about zero. Calibration is the same as that for sphase

     anti-trosy component so that there is not a need for the sel_flg
