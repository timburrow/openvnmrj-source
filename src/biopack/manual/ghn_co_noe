  ghn_co_noe.c

 DESCRIPTION and INSTRUCTION:

    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiment:
    3D CO-edited NOE-H(N)CO which correlates  HN-NOE with CO(i-1). 
    ni(t1)  ---> 1H
    ni2(t2) ---> 13CO

    REFERENCE:
    Weixing Zhang, Thomas E Smithgall and William H Gmeiner, JMR, B111, 305-309 (1996)	

    OFFSET POSITION:
        tof =   ~4.75 ppm (1H on water).
        dof =   174 ppm (13C on CO).
        dof2 =  120 ppm (15N region).

    CHOICE OF FLAGS:
    mag_flg = y --> Using magic angle gradients (Triax PFG probe is required).
    wgate == 'y'--> Using 3-9-19 watergate for water suppresion.
    wgate == 'n'--> Using gradient selection for water suppression.
    (for non-vnmr processing, gradsort should not be used since there is no 15N evolution.)
     
    flipback:  first character 'y' for primary flipback pulse
               second character 'y' for flipback within watergate 
 
    Modified the amplitude of the flipback pulse(s) (pwHs) to permit user adjustment
    around theoretical value (tpwrs). If tpwrsf < 4095.0 the value of tpwrs is increased 
    6db and values of tpwrsf of 2048 or so should give equivalent amplitude. In cases of 
    severe radiation damping( which happens during pwHs) the needed flip angle may be 
    much less than 90 degrees, so tpwrsf should be lowered to a value to minimize the 
    observed H2O signal in single-scan experiments (with ssfilter='n').(GG jan01)

    The waltz16 field strength is enterable (waltzB1).
    Typical values would be ~6-8ppm, (3500-5000 Hz at 600 MHz).
