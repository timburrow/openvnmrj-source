        Paramters:
        sspul       - flag for optional GRD-90-GRD steady-state sequence
        gt0         - gradient duration for sspul
        gzlvl0      - gradient power for sspul
        dpfgse_flg  - y - does post sequence water suppr. via excitation
                                sculpting
        trim_flg    - flag for optional trim pulse to suppress
                                protein background
        trim        - T1rho spinlock mixing time (CW)
        trimpwr     - spin-lock power level during trim
        d1          - relaxation delay
        xferdly     - saturation transfer delay ( ~1.5-2sec)
        satshape    - shape of the pulses in the pulse-train (def:gauss)
        d3          - interpulse delay in the xfer pulsetrain
                        ( 1 msec is recommenden in the literature
                                with no obvious reason)
        satpwr      - power level for the saturation pulse-train
                       (in the literature 86 Hz peak power is recommended
                       corresponding to a 630 deg. flip angle at 50 msec satpw
                       please note that the actual flip angle is irrelevant,
                       the selectivity is controlled by the power level, satpwr)
        satpw       - pulse width of the shaped pulses in the pulse train
                            duration ca 50 ms
        satfrq      - frequency for protein saturation
                         (use a region with an intense protein signal
                         and NO ligand signal)
        satfrqref   - reference frequency (outside the signal region ~at 30ppm)
        wrefshape   - shape of the 180 deg pulse for solvent supp.
                         rectangular shape is recommended
        wrefpwr     - power of 180 deg pulse for solvent suppression
        wrefpwrf    - fine power for wrefshape by default it is 2048
                       needs optimization for multiple solvent suppression only
                          with fixed wrefpw
        wrefpw      - selective 180 deg pulse width for solvent supp
                                duration ca 2-4 ms
        gzlvl2      - gradient levels during the DPFG echos
        gt2         - gradient time during the DPFG echos
        gstab       - recovery delay
        alt_grd     - flag to alternate gradient signs after each subsequent
                           nt pairs
