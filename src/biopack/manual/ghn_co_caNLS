    3D HNCOCA Non-linearly sampled gradient sensitivity enhanced version.


Non-Linear Sampling (For VNMRJ)
------------------


1) Setup the ghn_ca experiment in the normal manner. In VNMRJ select the 
  "Switch to Non-Linear Sampling" button. This runs the macro "BP_NLSsetup" 
   macro which will create the necessary parameters (sampsched, nli, nli2, 
   t1_counter and t2_counter).
2) Enter the sampling schedule name (this should be placed in your 
   vnmrsys/manual as a simple text file) in the appropriate entry box 
   (sets variable "sampsched")
3) Select "Setup Schedule". This runs the "BP_NLSschedule" macro which uses 
   the sampling schedule to set up t1_counter and t2_counter arrays. The total 
   number of fids and approximate time of the experiment is shown. If a
   different schedule is desired there is a "Clear Schedule" button. 
4) The variables nli and nli2 contain the number of the maximum evol.time inc.
   if the experiment is done with linear sampling. This can be used to
   calculate the resolution in each dimension (nli/sw1 and nli2/sw2) in Hz. 
4) Set phase = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 in that order. Leave the ni and ni2 at 1.
   If you type "da" at this point the size of the array should be
   4*(no of points in your sechdule).
5) Choose the appropriate nt, sw1 and sw2.
6) The total evolution time in each dimension is given by the dwell time * max
   point in that dimension. For experiments with constant time evolution in the 
   Nitrogen dimension, make sure that sw is large enough to accommodate 
   the maximum no of Nitrogen dimension points (the limit is that dw*max
   < constant time delay, where max is the largest entry in the 
   sampling scheme for the nitrogen dimension)
7) The non-linear sampled data can be processed and converted into XEASY or
   NMRPipe formats,using the software suite "Rowland NMR Tool Kit" (rnmrtk), 
   available from J. Hoch and A. Stern (http://webmac.rowland.org/rnmrtk/).

    Correlates Ca(i) with N(i+1), NH(i+1).  Uses constant time evolution for the
    15N shifts.

    Standard features include square pulses on Cab with first null at 13CO; one
    lobe sinc pulses on 13CO with first null at Ca; shaka6 composite 180 pulse
    to simultaneously refocus CO and invert Ca; one lobe sinc pulse to put H2O
    back along z (the sinc one-lobe is significantly more selective than
    gaussian, square, or seduce 90 pulses); optional 2H decoupling when CaCb 
    magnetization is transverse for 4 channel spectrometers.  

    Magic-angle option for coherence transfer gradients.  TROSY option for
    N15/H1 evolution/detection.

        	  CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

    	Set dm = 'nnn', dmm = 'ccc' 
    	Set dm2 = 'nny', dmm2 = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for 15N decoupling.
	Set dm3 = 'nnn' for no 2H decoupling, or
		  'nyn'  and dmm3 = 'cwc' for 2H decoupling. 
  
    Must set phase = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI acquisition in
    t1 [13C]  and t2 [15N].
    
    The flag f1180/f2180 should be set to 'y' if t1/t2 is to be started at
    halfdwell time. This will give 90, -180 phasing in f1/f2. If it is set to
    'n' the phasing should be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.  Thus,
    set f1180='n' for (0,0) in 13C and f2180='n' for (0,0) in 15N.  f1180='y' is
    ignored if ni=0, and f2180='y' is ignored if ni2=0.



          	  DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF ghn_co_caNLS


    1. Obtain a printout of the Philosopy behind the BioPack development,
       and General Instructions using the macro: 
                                      "printon man('BioPack') printoff".
       These Detailed Instructions for ghn_co_caNLS may be printed using:
                                      "printon man('ghn_co_caNLS') printoff".

    2. Apply the setup macro "ghn_co_caNLS". This loads the parameter set
       and also sets ni=ni2=0 and phase=phase2=1 ready for a 1D spectral check.
       At the middle of the t1 period, the 180 degree pulses on CO and 15N are
       swapped to a 180 degree pulse on Ca, for the first increment of t1, to
       refocus Ca chemical-shift evolution ensuring a zero first-order phase
       correction in F1. This is also the case for the 1D spectral check, or
       for 2D/15N spectra, when ni=0.

    3. Centre H1 frequency on H2O (4.7ppm), C13 frequency on 56ppm, and N15 
       frequency on the amide region (120 ppm).  The C13 frequency is shifted to
       the CO region during the sequence, but phase coherence is not required 
       after each shift.

    4. The normal 13C 180 degree pulse on CO at the middle of t1 induces a
       phase shift, which should be field-invariant, and so this phase shift has
       been calibrated and compensated in the pulse sequence. This phase shift
       can be checked by setting ni=1 whereby a special 1D method is invoked
       in which both the 13C CO 180 degree pulse and the simultaneous 15N 180
       degree pulse are applied just as for all t1 times other than t1=0.  First
       eliminate the CO pulse by setting pwC9=0 and obtain a 1D spectrum. This
       spectrum will have reduced intensity compared to ni=0 because of 13Ca
       chemical-shift evolution during the time of the 180 pulses. If the
       phase shift is adequately compensated, a second very similar 1D spectrum
       will be obtained with pwC9=pwC8.  As described in more detail for  
       ghn_co, a more sensitive comparison of the two spectra with pwC9=0,pwC8 
       can be obtained with phase=2.  If not adequately compensated, the
       first increment will be out of phase with all succeeding increments and a
       zero-order phase-shift will be necessary in F1, which is easily done
       after the 2D/3D transform. Alternatively, change the calibration by
       changing the phshift9 parameter in the INITIALIZE VARIABLES section of
       the code. The pulse pwC9 is automatically reset to its calibrated value
       (=pwC8) within the pulse sequence code for 3D work and 2D/t1 studies.
       DO NOT CHANGE pwC8 from its calibrated value.

    5. H2O preservation is achieved according to Kay et al, except that a sinc
       one-lobe selective pulse is used to put H2O back along z.  This is much
       more selective than a hard, Seduce1, or gaussian pulse.

    6. Another difference from the work of Kay et al is that the phases of the
       first and last Ca 90 degree pulses are alternated to eliminate artifacts
       from the CO 180 degree pulse.

    7. tauC (4.5 ms) and timeTN (12.5 ms) were determined for alphalytic 
       protease and are listed in dg2 for possible readjustment by the user.

    8. TROSY:
       Set TROSY='y' and dm2='nnn' for a TROSY spectrum of the bottom right
       peak of the 2D coupled NH quartet (high-field H1, low-field N15).  The 
       TROSY spectrum gives 50% S/N compared to the decoupled spectrum for a 
       small peptide.  To select any of the other three peaks of the 2D coupled
       quartet, in a clockwise direction from bottom right, change t4/t10
       from x/y to x/-y to -x/-y to -x/y.  NOTE, the phases of the SE train
       are almost the same as those determined for the gNhsqc sequence.  The
       major difference is that kappa is eliminated compared to normal
       ghn_co_ca so the N15 magnetization has not evolved with respect to the 
       attached H's.  I.e. the N15 state would be Ix rather than IySz if there 
       was no coherence gradient - this imparts a 90 degree shift so t8 is 
       changed to y (from x in the normal spectrum).  Also gzlvl1 is after the
       180 N15 pulse rather than before as in gNhsqc, so the sign of icosel 
       and the t4/t10 phase2 increments are also swapped compared to gNhsqc.
       For ghn_c... type sequences, H1 decoupling during the first timeTN is
       replaced by a pi pulse at kappa/2 to reduce S/N loss for large molecules
       during the first TN period.  For these sequences H2O flipback is 
       achieved with two sinc one-lobe pulses, an additional one just before
       the SE train, similar to gNhsqc.

    9. Radiation Damping:
       At fields 600MHz and higher with high-Q probes, radiation damping is a
       factor to be considered. Its primary effect is in the flipback pulse
       calibration. Radiation damping causes a rotation back to the +Z axis
       even without a flipback pulse. Hence, the pwHs pulse often needs to 
       be reduced in its flip-angle. This can be accomplished by using the
       parameter tpwrsf. If this value is less than 4095.0 the value of tpwrs
       (calculated in the psg code) is increased by 6dB, thereby permitting
       the value of tpwrsf to be optimized to obtain minimum H2O in the 
       spectrum. The value of tpwrsf is typically lower than 2048 (half-maximum
       to compensate for the extra 6dB in tpwrs).
