 C13_TROSY_CH2

    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiment:
   13C-1H TROSY  for methylene protons
      reference E.Miclet.... Ad Bax JACS v126, pp 10560-10570, 2004
      some aspects: Shaka's papers
         JMR v136 p54  1999
         JMR v151 p269 2001

        	  CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

    Set dm = 'nny', dmm = 'ccp'  for C13 decoupling.
    Set dm2 = 'nnn'  for N15 decoupling.

    Must set phase = 1,2  for States-TPPI acquisition in t1 
         set f1coef= '1 0 -1 0 0 -1 0 -1
    
    The flag f1180 should be set to 'y' if t1 is to be started at halfdwell
    time. This will give 90, -180 phasing in f1. If it is set to 'n' the 
    phasing should be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.  Thus,
    set f1180='n' for (0,0) in N15.  f1180='y' is ignored if ni=0.
