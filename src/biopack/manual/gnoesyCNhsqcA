    3D C13,N15 edited noesy with separation via the carbon of the destination site
         recorded on a water sample 
    includes optional "WET" water suppression in relaxation delay
    includes optional magic-angle gradients

    pwNlvl and pwClvl lowered 3dB each from normal BioPack experiments 
    because of simultaneous pulses and decoupling.

    Uses three channels:
         1)  1H             - carrier @ water  
         2) 13C             - carrier @ 43 ppm (CA/CB)
         3) 15N             - carrier @ 118 ppm

    Set dm = 'nnny', [13C decoupling during acquisition].
    (13C decoupling in t1 is done by a composite pulse)
    Set dm2 = 'nynn', [15N dec during t1] 
    Set dm2 = 'nyny', [15N dec during t1 and acquisition] 

    Must set phase = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI
    acquisition in t1 [H]  and t2 [C].

    Set f1180 = 'y' and f2180 = 'y' for (90,-180) in F1 and (90,-180) in F2.
    Use linear prediction in t2 for the first few points to flatten baseline
      The macro setlp2 could be used, e.g. setlp2(128,32,2) for extending
      to 128 complex points in t2 from 32 acquired complex points, with the
      first two complex points in t2 linear predicted


   "setlp2(new ni2,ni2 used,frontpoints)"
    parlp(2)
    if $#>2 then
     lpopt2='b','f' strtlp2=$3,$2
     lpfilt2=8 lpnupts2=$2-$3,$2 lpext2=$3,$1-$2
     strtext2=$3,$2+1
     setsb2(2*$1) fn2=2*$1 proc2='lp'
    else
     lpopt2='f' strtlp2=$2
     lpfilt2=8 lpnupts2=$2 lpext2=$1-$2
     strtext2=$2+1
     setsb2(2*$1) fn2=2*$1 proc2='lp'
    endif


    Note: Zero order phase correct may not be exactly +90 in F2 due to C=O 
          decoupling pulse.

    Modified to use only z-gradients 
    Modified to use pwC/pwClvl/pwN/pwNlvl/compC as in other BioPack/
     sequences. The parameter "compN" is added to permit accurate lower power
     N15 pulses. This parameter should be calibrated by determining the pw90
     for N15 at the normal pwNlvl(pw1) and 3db lower(pw2). Then,      
     compN=pw2/(2.0*pw1). Use ghn_co or gNhsqc for these calibrations.

    Modified to use BioPack-style of C=O decoupling
     
    STUD DECOUPLING.   SET STUD='y':
       Setting the flag STUD='y' overrides the decoupling parameters listed in
       dg2 and applies STUD+ decoupling instead.  In consequence is is easy
       to swap between the decoupling scheme you have been using to STUD+ for
       an easy comparison.  The STUD+ waveforms are calculated for your field
       strength at the time of BioPack installation and RF power is 
       calculated within the pulse sequence.  The calculations are for the most 
       peaks being greater than 90% of ideal. If you wish to compare different 
       decoupling schemes, the power level used for STUD+ can be obtained from 
       dps - subtract 3dB from that level to compare to decoupling schemes at
       a continuous RF level such as GARP.  The value of 90% has
       been set to limit sample heating as much as possible.  If you wish to 
       change STUD parameters, for example to increase the quality of decoupling
       (and RF heating) change the 95% level for the centerband
       by changing the relevant number in the macro makeSTUDpp and 
       rerun the macro (don't use 100% !!).  (At the time of writing STUD has
       been coded to use the coarse attenuator, because the fine attenuator
       is not presently included in the fail-safe calculation of decoupling 
       power which aborts an experiment if the power is too high - this may
       lower STUD efficiency a little).
