 ghnco_Jnca_3DS3.c 

This pulse sequence records 1J(NCa), 2J(NCa), 2J(HNCa) and 3J(HNCa) 
couplings in a 1H-15N-13C' correlation spectrum. 
The spin-state-selection (referred here as S3) is provided along 
with the TROSY selection.

Set lambda to reasonable value to scale up NCa couplings in t2.
 
Set 13C carrier (dof) on CO-region. Apply Ca off-resonance.

Set phase=1,2 phase2=1,2,3,4 for S3-edited 3D-experiment.

Set jcoca=53 and jhn=93.

For a 1D check, set ni=1, ni2=1, phase=1, phase2=1 and use wft.

For a 2D experiment:

CH: set ni, phase=1,2 phase2=1 and f1coef='1 0 0 0 0 0 -1 0'.
        Use wft2da. This gives a 13CO-1HN correlation spectrum.

NH: set ni2, phase=1, phase2=1,2 and f2coef='1 0 -1 0 0 1 0 1'.
        Use wft2da('ni2'). This gives a 15N-1HN correlation spectrum.
        The cross peaks are split by 1J(NCa) and 2J(NCa), and 2J(HNCa) 
        and 3J(HNCa) couplings in 15N and 1H dimensions, respectively.

        The coefficient lambda defines scaling factor for 1J(NCa) and 
        2J(NCa), if set to 1, the 1(JNCa) and 2J(NCa) are scaled with 
        respect 15N shift by a factor of two. If lambda=0, the 1J(NCa) 
        and 2J(NCa) couplings are not scaled.

For a 2D S3 experiment

NH: set ni2, phase2=1,2,3,4 and phase=1.
        Use wft2d('ni2',1,0,-1,0,1,0,-1,0,0,-1,0,-1,0,-1,0,-1) for 
        adding data. 
        This shows the upfield component of 2J(NCa) doublet, which 
        is further split by 1J(NCa). The corresponding 3J(HNCa) and 
        2J(HNCa) couplings can be measured from 1H dimension
         
        Use wft2d('ni2',1,0,-1,0,-1,0,1,0,0,-1,0,-1,0,1,0,1) for 
        subtracting data.
        This shows the downfield component of 2J(NCa) doublet, which 
        is further split by 1J(NCa). The corresponding 3J(HNCa) and 
        2J(HNCa) couplings can be measured from 1H dimension

For a 3D S3 experiment:

        Set ni, ni2, phase=1,2 phase2=1,2,3,4 and f1coef='1 0 0 0 0 0 -1 0'. 
        
        f2coef='1 0 -1 0 1 0 -1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1' followed by ft3d gives 
        a three-dimensional 13CO, 15N, 1HN correlation spectrum displaying
        the upfield component of 2J(NCa) doublet (further split by 1J(NCa)
        in 15N dimension. The corresponding 3J(HNCa) and 2J(HNCa) couplings
        can be measured from 1H dimension.

        f2coef='1 0 -1 0 -1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 -1 0 -1' followed by ft3d gives
        a three-dimensional 13CO, 15N, 1HN correlation spectrum displaying
        the downfield component of 2J(NCa) doublet (further split by 1J(NCa)
        in 15N dimension. The corresponding 3J(HNCa) and 2J(HNCa) couplings
        can be measured from 1H dimension.
