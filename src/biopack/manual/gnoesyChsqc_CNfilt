	gnoesyChsqc_CNfilt

	Sequence for F1 13C,15N-filtered NOESY-HSQC(13C) experiment, 
        with option for carbonyl and 15N decoupling during t2.

	Created: as mf_f13c_noe_hsqc_s13c.c 11/19/2003 by M. Rance, U.Cincinnati
        Modified for BioPack, added "autocal" option for automatic creation
        of carbonyl decoupling pulse, GG, Varian, November 2005

	Uses isotope-filtering element invented by Stuart et al.,
	J.Am.Chem.Soc. 121, 5346-5347 (1999)

	Set:
	d2	= 0
	tauxh	= 1/(4Jxh)

        satmode = 'y' for presat
	satdly	= length of presaturation period
	satpwr	= power level for presat

	gstab   = gradient recovery delay

        NOTE: the parameter dof_t1 sets the C13 frequency during t1, not dof.
              dof is the C13 frequency during the HSQC and decoupling period.

        Filter Gradients:
	gt2	= cleaning gradient
	gt3	= gradient pulse during initial IzSz period
	gt4	= gradient pulse during second IzSz period 
	gt5	= cleaning gradient
        
        For gt2=gt3=gt4=gt5, gzlvl2-gzlvl3+gzlvl4+gzlvl5 must =0.

        Half-dwell time delay standard in t1 and t2. Use lp1=-180 
        rp1=90; lp2=-180 rp2=90 for proper phasing.

        To permit adjustment of the filter gradients' strength, the
        parameter gscale can be used. It will multiply gzlvl2,gzlvl3,
        gzlvl4 and gzlvl5 by the same factor. The ratio must be 
        maintained, however.
