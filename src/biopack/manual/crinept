	Run as four fid experiment, for phase=1,2 and psi2=1,2 
	with array='phase,psi2'. 

	The quartet of fids collected are...
	
	fid1 = inphase(?) & real t1
	fid2 = antiphase(?) & real t1
	fid3 = inphase(?) & imaginary t1
	fid4 = antiphase(?) & imaginary t1

        For Non-VNMR Processing:
	Data is processed by adding fid1 to fid2 and then phase correcting 
	90 degrees for the real t1 point. Imaginary t1 point is likewise
	obtained by subtracting fid4 from fid3 and phase correcting the result 
	by 90 degrees.

        For VNMR Processing:
         wft2d(1,1,1,1,-1,1,1,-1,-1,1,1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1)

	Set:
	d2	= 0
        corr    =      empirical delay for obtaining lp=0
                       run 2D, phase in f1/f2, enter "crof2", note change in rof2+alfa and
                       use this for "corr". Rerun 2D, rephase and lp should be closer to zero.
	tauT	= 3 to 5.4 msec
	psi2	= 1,2  for inphase/antiphase separation
        phase   = 1,2  for States/TPPI

	gt1	= 400 usec
	gzlvl1  = 15 G/cm

        phincr_d       optional phase shifting for soft pulse. If BioPack-optimized pulse is
                        present (at H2Osinc_d.RF), it has a phase correction built-in. This
                        variable permits further shifting.Set to zero normally.
