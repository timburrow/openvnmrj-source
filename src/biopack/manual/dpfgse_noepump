                J. Am. Chem. Soc. 120, 10258-10259 (1998).

parameters:
        delflag   - 'y' runs the Dbppste sequence
                    'n' runs the normal s2pul sequence
        del       -  the actual diffusion delay
        gt1       - total diffusion-encoding pulse width
        gzlvl1    - diffusion-encoding pulse strength
        gzlvlhs   - homospoil gradient during mixing
        gths      - homospoil gradient duration
        wrefshape - shape file of the 180 deg. selective refocussing pulse
                      on the solvent (may be convoluted for multiple solvents)
        wrefpw    - pulse width for wrefshape (as given by Pbox)
        wrefpwr   - power level for wrefshape (as given by Pbox)
        wrefpwrf  - fine power for wrefshape by default it is 2048
                      needs optimization for multiple solvent suppression only
                      with fixed wrefpw
        alt_grd   - alternate gradient sign(s) in dpfgse on even transients
        trim_flg  - flag for an optional trim pulse at the end of the sequence
                              set trim_flg='y' tu suppress protein background
        trim      - pulse width of the trim pusle for trim_flg='y' (in seconds!!)
        trimpwr   - power level for the trim pulse for trim_flg='y'
        compH     - 1H amplifier compression
        dpfgse_flg- flag for solvent suppression with excitation sculpting
        gt2       - dpfgse diffusion-encoding pulse width
        gzlvl2    - dpfgse encoding pulse strength
        gstab     - gradient stabilization delay (~0.0002-0.0003 sec)
        satmode   - 'y' turns on presaturation

        tau taken as time between the mid-points
        of the bipolar gradient pulses.
