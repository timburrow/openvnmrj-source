  The (HN-HA) coupling constant (J) is related to the intensities of cross peak
  (Ic) and diagonal peak (Id) according to the following equation (Ref 4):

     Ic/Id ~ -tan[PI*J*(del1+del2)]*tan[PI*J(del1+del2)]

  Uses three channels:
	1)  1H  (t1, HA), (t3, HN) 	-carrier at 4.7 ppm (tof)
	2) 13C                      	-carrier at 174 ppm (dof)
 	3) 15N  (t2, 15N)   		-carrier at 118 ppm (dof2)


  JR_flg  = y     using jump-return water suppression (ref 2).
                   uses tau_JR interpulse delay with adjustable width
                   of second pulse (pwJR).
          = n     using watergate for water suppression (ref 3).

  mag_flg = y     using magic angle pulsed field gradient for watergate.
            n     using z-axis gradient only.

  flg_3919='y'    uses 3919 watergate with tau_3919 delay.
  flg_3919= n     uses soft-pulse watergate (when JR_flg='n'). Small-angle
                   phase correction (phasestep) in 0.25deg steps optional.
                   BioPack "H2Osinc.RF" shape(1418 steps)
                   is used as default. Use pwHs=1418*n for no waveform
                   error messages. Since only NH is detected, 1.418 msec is
                   a reasonably selected pulse.

  c13_flg='y'     uses Pbox-generated CaCO.DEC for 13C decoupling of 40ppm 
                  in alphaC region and 20ppm in C=O region. CaCO.DEC is
                  generated when the propack2 macro is used to update    
                  parameter sets, and when autocalibration is used.
