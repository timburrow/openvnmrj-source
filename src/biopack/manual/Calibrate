Use Probefile Values
********************

This button will start an autocalibration process in which the current parameter 
values in the Probefile are used as starting points.

Use this tof
************
This button will start an autocalibration process in which the current parameter 
values in the Probefile are used as starting points except for tof, in which case
the tof value in the current parameter set is used.

Use this tof/pw
***************
This button will start an autocalibration process in which the current parameter 
values in the Probefile are used as starting points except for tof and pw, for which 
the tof and pw values in the current parameter set are used.

Do H/C/N RF Only
****************
This button will start an autocalibration process in which the current parameter 
values in the Probefile are used as starting points but only the RF calibrations
are performed, skipping gradient and small-angle phase shift calibrations.

Do 1H RF Only
****************
This button will start an autocalibration process in which the current parameter 
values in the Probefile are used as starting points but only the 1H RF calibrations
are performed on a 13C-enriched sample.

Do 15N RF Only
****************
This button will start an autocalibration process in which the current parameter 
values in the Probefile are used as starting points but only the 15N RF calibrations
are performed on a 15N-enriched sample. No gradients are calibrated.

Do 13C RF Only
****************
This button will start an autocalibration process in which the current parameter 
values in the Probefile are used as starting points but only the 13C RF calibrations
are performed on a 13C-enriched sample. No gradients are calibrated.

Other Calibrations
