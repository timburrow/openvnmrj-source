Use Semi-constant time in CO dimension so that more increments
can be used in the CO dimension.  Maximun ni is set to 64.

When sw1 = 2000, the value of ratio at different ni is:
ni    = 64,   48,   32,   24,   14 (minimum value)
ratio = 0.38, 0.50, 0.76, 1.01, 1.74

if the calculated value is larger than 1.0, it will be set to 1.0.
Semi-constant time evolution is used when ratio is smaller than 1.0
Constant time evolution is used when ratio is 1.0.

Recommended value: ratio = 0.5 to 1.0.

 3D experiment correlates HN(i), N(i) and CO (both i and i-1).
 Ref: Frank Lorh and Heinz Ruterjans,  JBNMR, 6 (1995) 189-197.

    Uses three(four) channels:
         1)  1H   (t3)       - carrier  4.7 ppm (tof)
         2) 13CO  (t1, ni)   - carrier  174 ppm  (dof)
                               SLP pulses are used for CA
         3) 15N   (t2, ni2)  - carrier  120 ppm (dof2) 
         4) 2H               - at lock frequency

    The waltz16 field strength is enterable (waltzB1).
    Typical values would be ~6-8ppm, (3500-5000 Hz at 600 MHz).
