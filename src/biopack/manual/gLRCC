  gLRCC 

DESCRIPTION and INSTRUCTION:

    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiment:
    3D LRCC with choice of sensitivity enhancement.

    ni(t1) --> 13C
    ni2(t2)--> 13C

    REFERENCE:
        Ad Bax et al., JBNMR, 4, 787-797 (1994)

    OFFSET POSITION:
        tof =   ~4.75 ppm (1H on water).
        dof =   35 ppm (middle of CA and methyl carbon).
        dof2 =  120 ppm (15N region, not used in this experiment).

    CHOICE OF FLAGS:
    mag_flg = y -> Using magic angle gradients (Triax PFG probe is required).
    shaka6[A] = y --->to obtain J coupling for both Leu and Val.
    SE_flg = y  --> Sensitivity enhanced version.
