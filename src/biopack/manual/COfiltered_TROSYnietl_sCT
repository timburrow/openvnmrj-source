COfiltered_TROSYnietl_sCT is used to measure the 1-bond 
Jnco/Dnco by a TROSY-based 2D J-modulated experiment.
To share chem shift labeling with J-mod delay, a 
constant time or semi-constant time setup is automatically 
determined in the pulse seq, i.e., the user does not 
need to explicitly specify anything. To cancel relaxation 
effects, "Cfilter" should be arrayed (Cfilter = y,n). 
When Cfilter==y, J/D coupling is active. Otherwise it's 
refocused. The peak intesity ratio of Cfilter==y over 
Cfilter==n remove relaxation effect. "tCN" specifies the
Jmod delay. Since S/N decays as "tCN" gets bigger, a 
larger number of scans (nt) is recommended for larger tCN values.
The user can array tCN along with nt, array='(tCN,nt),Cfilter,phase' 
(I haven't tried this myself --Yizhou) or simply
open several experiments and in each specify a tCN and nt (I did this way).

About shaped pulses: 
COfiltered_TROSYnietl_sCT uses offC8, offC3 and offC6 in Biopack. 
They can be generated by loading ghn_co.
