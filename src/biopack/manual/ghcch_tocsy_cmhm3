        	  CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

    	Set dm = 'nny', dmm = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for 13C decoupling.
	Set dm3 = 'nnn' for no 2H decoupling, or
		  'nyn'  and dmm3 = 'w' for 2H decoupling. 
  
    Must set phase = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI acquisition in
    t1 [1H]  and t2 [13C].

    2D experiment in t1: wft2d(1,0,-1,0,0,1,0,1) (sensitivity-enhanced)
    2D experiment in t2: wft2d('ni2',1,0,-1,0,0,1,0,1) (sensitivity-enhanced)
    ( or with 5.2F or above just use wft2da or wft2da('ni2') after setting
      f1coef='1 0 -1 0 0 1 0 1'
      f2coef='1 0 -1 0 0 1 0 1'
     for 3D just use ft3d )
    
    The flag f1180/f2180 should be set to 'y' if t1/t2 is to be started at
    halfdwell time. This will give -90, 180 phasing in f1/f2. If it is set to
    'n' the phasing should be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.  Thus,
    set f1180='n' for (0,0) in 13C and f2180='n' for (0,0) in 15N.  f1180='y' is
    ignored if ni=0, and f2180='y' is ignored if ni2=0.
