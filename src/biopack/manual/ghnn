  ghnn.c

    3D HNN gradient sensitivity enhanced version.

    Correlates N(i), NH(i) with N(i-1), NH(i-1), and N(i+1), NH(i+1).  Uses constant time
    evolution for the 15N shifts.

    t1 not limited by kappa

    Standard features include maintaining the 13C carrier in the Ca region
    throughout using off-res SLP pulses; square pulses on Ca with first
    null at 13CO; one lobe sinc pulses on 13CO with first null at Ca; one lobe
    sinc pulse to put H2O back along z (the sinc one-lobe is significantly more
    selective than gaussian, square, or seduce 90 pulses); optional 2H 
    decoupling when CaCb magnetization is transverse for 4 channel 
    spectrometers.  

    Magic-angle option for coherence transfer gradients.  TROSY option for
    N15/H1 evolution/detection.

        	  CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

    	Set dm = 'nnn', dmm = 'ccc' 
    	Set dm2 = 'nny', dmm2 = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for 15N decoupling.
	Set dm3 = 'nnn' for no 2H decoupling, or
		  'nyn'  and dmm3 = 'cwc' for 2H decoupling. 
  

    The waltz16 field strength is enterable (waltzB1).
    Typical values would be ~6-8ppm, (3500-5000 Hz at 600 MHz).
  
    Must set = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI acquisition in
    t1 [15N]  and t2 [15N].

    The flag f1180/f2180 should be set to 'y' if t1/t2 is to be started at
    halfdwell time. This will give 90, -180 phasing in f1/f2. If it is set to
    'n' the phasing should be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.  Thus,
    set f1180='n' for (0,0) in 15N and f2180='n' for (0,0) in 15N.  f1180='y' is
    ignored if ni=0, and f2180='y' is ignored if ni2=0.



           	  DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF ghnn

    1. Obtain a printout of the Philosopy behind the BioPack development,
       and General Instructions using the macro: 
                                      "printon man('BioPack') printoff".
       These Detailed Instructions for ghnn may be printed using:
                                      "printon man('ghnn') printoff".
             
    2. Apply the setup macro "ghnn".  This loads the relevant parameter set
       and also sets ni=ni2=0 and phase=phase2=1 ready for a 1D spectral check.

    3. Center H1 frequency on H2O (4.7ppm), C13 on 56ppm,  and N15 frequency
       on the amide region (120ppm). The C13 frequency remains at 56ppm,
       ie at Ca throughout the sequence.

    4. timeTN (14 ms) was determined for alphalytic protease using ghn_ca and is listed in 
       dg2 for possible readjustment by the user. timeCN is typ. 10-15msec.

    8. The coherence-transfer gradients using power levels
       gzlvl1 and gzlvl2 may be either z or magic-angle gradients. For the
       latter, a proper /vnmr/imaging/gradtable entry must be present and
       syscoil must contain the value of this entry (name of gradtable). The
       amplitude of the gzlvl1 and gzlvl2 should be lower than for a z axis
       probe to have the x and y gradient levels within the 32k range. For
       any value, a dps display (using power display) shows the x,y and z
       dac values. These must be <=32k.

    9. TROSY:
       Set TROSY='y' and dm2='nnn' for a TROSY spectrum of the bottom right
       peak of the 2D coupled NH quartet (high-field H1, low-field N15).  The 
       TROSY spectrum gives 50% S/N compared to the decoupled spectrum for a 
       small peptide.  To select any of the other three peaks of the 2D coupled
       quartet, in a clockwise direction from bottom right, change t4/t10
       from x/y to x/-y to -x/-y to -x/y.  NOTE, the phases of the SE train
       are almost the same as those determined for the gNhsqc sequence.  The
       major difference is that kappa is eliminated compared to normal
       ghnn so the N15 magnetization has not evolved with respect to the 
       attached H's.  I.e. the N15 state would be Ix rather than IySz if there 
       was no coherence gradient - this imparts a 90 degree shift so t8 is 
       changed to y (from x in the normal spectrum).  Also gzlvl1 is after the
       180 N15 pulse rather than before as in gNhsqc, so the sign of icosel 
       and the t4/t10 phase2 increments are also swapped compared to gNhsqc.
       For ghn_c... type sequences, H1 decoupling during the first timeTN is
       replaced by a pi pulse at kappa/2 to reduce S/N loss for large molecules
       during the first TN period.  For these sequences H2O flipback is 
       achieved with two sinc one-lobe pulses, an additional one just before
       the SE train, similar to gNhsqc.
