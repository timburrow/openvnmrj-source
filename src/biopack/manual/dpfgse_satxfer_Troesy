dpfgse_satxfer_Troesy.c - STD rotating frame NOE experiment with T-Roesy modification 
              allows T-Roesy or standard cw Roesy

             OBSERVE TRANSMITTER SHOULD BE SET AT SOLVENT POSITION
             SATURATION,SPIN LOCK AND PULSES ALL USE OBS.XMTR

        pw = 90 degree pulse on protons (power level at "tpwr")
      tpwr = power level for the spin lock pulse(s)
  strength = amplitufe of the B1 mixing field (in Hz)
     compH = 1H amplifier compression factor
     T_flg = 'y' gives pulsed T-Roesy; 'n': cw Roesy
     phase = 1,2: F1 quadrature by the hypercomplex method
       mix = mixing time
 wrefshape = shape file of the 180 deg. selective refocussing pulse
             on the solvent (may be convoluted for
             multiple solvents)
   wrefpw  = pulse width for wrefshape (as given by Pbox)
   wrefpwr = power level for wrefshape (as given by Pbox)
  wrefpwrf = fine power for wrefshape
                by default it is 2048 needs optimization for
                multiple solvent with fixed wrefpw suppression only
       gt2 = gradient duration for the solvent suppression echo
    gzlvl2 = gradient power for the solvent suppression echo
   alt_grd = flag for alternating gradient sign in mix-dpfgse segment
     gstab = gradient stabilization delay
     sspul = 'y': activates gradient-90degree-gradient pulse prior to d1
       gt1 = gradient pulse duration for sspul
    gzlvl1 = gradient pulse amplitude for sspul
   xferdly = saturation transfer delay ( ~1.5-2sec)
  satshape = shape of the pulses in the pulse-train (def:gauss)
        d3 = interpulse delay in the xfer pulsetrain
                   ( 1 msec is recommenden in the literature
                     with no obvious reason)
    satpwr = power level for the saturation pulse-train
               (in the literature 86 Hz peak power is recommended
               corresponding to a 630 deg. flip angle at 50 msec satpw
               please note that the actual flip angle is irrelevant,
               the selectivity is controlled by the power level, satpwr)
     satpw = pulse width of the shaped pulses in the pulse train
                           duration ca 50 ms
    satfrq = frequency for protein saturation
                         (use a region with an intense protein signal
                         and NO ligand signal)
 satfrqref = reference frequency (outside the signal region ~at 30ppm)
  trim_flg = flag for an optional trim pulse at the end of the
                  sequence
                  set trim_flg='y' tu suppress protein background
      trim = pulse width of the trim pusle for trim_flg='y'
   trimpwr = power level for the trim pulse for trim_flg='y'
        nt = min:  multiple of 4; max:  multiple of 8
