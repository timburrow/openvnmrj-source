         This procedure optimizes performance on a first-
        increment HCCH-TOCSY experiment with respect to
        1H pw90 and 13C pw90. The 13C amplifier compression,
        15N pw90, and coherence-transfer gradient are optimized.

         The optimum repetition rate is determined using an 15N
        gradient HSQC experiment.

         Gradient calibrations are done for N15 and C13 hsqc,
        as well as for a doubly sensitivity-enhanced hcchtocsy.

          All calibration data are stored in the AutoTripRes
        directory and parlib entries updated.

         First-increment (ni=0, ni2=0) fids are collected and
        the data are stored in the AutoTripRes directory and
        the spectra are plotted. The number of transients is
        adjusted such that the hnco data set has s:n>20. All
        triple-resonance data sets are then acquired with this
        number of transients.
