  T1ND 

    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following
    experiment:

    2D 2H T1 measurment of samples with deuterium incorporation
    with resolution achieved by 2D 13C,1H CT. (Methyl groups)
    Used for high resolution high sensitivity 13C spectrum.

    Uses three channels:
         1)  1H             - 4.73 ppm 
         2) 13C             - 19.0 ppm 
         3) 15N             - 119.0 ppm  

    Set dm = 'nnny', dmm = 'cccp' [13C decoupling during acquisition].
    Set dm2 = 'nnnn', dmm2 = 'cccp'.

    Must set phase = 1,2 for States-TPPI
    acquisition in t1 [13C].
    
    The flag f1180 should be set to 'y' if t1 is 
    to be started at halfdwell time. This will give -90, 180
    phasing in f1. If it is set to 'n' the phasing will
    be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.

    Records carbon chemical shift during the second CT period

    Modified by L.E.Kay on Jan 19,96 to ensure a delay of 4us
     between power statements and pulses. 

    Modified by L.E.Kay on Jan 31, 1996 to eliminate phase difference
     between rectangular and reburp pulses.

    Modified by A. Lee on 5/20/97 into a psuedo-3D experiment
    
    Relaxation delays(z_array) are "hard-coded", here set for eight values. The
    variable ni2 should be used to specify the total number of mixing times.    
    Duplicate times are included for a consistency check
