  ghnco_trosy_3DA.c - auto-calibrated version

    3D HNCO with trosy(enhanced sensitivity PFG)
    with selective pulses to minimize excitation of water
                       F1      CO 
                       F2      15N + JNH/2
                       F3(acq) 1H (NH) - JNH/2


    Pulse scheme uses TROSY principle in 15N and NH with transfer of
    magnetization achieved using the enhanced sensitivity pfg approach,

    If sel_flg =='n' then the component of interest is not actively 
    selected for; relaxation will attenuate the undesired component.
    Selection is achieved during the first N---> 13C' transfer.

    In general it is very difficult to present rules indicating when
    sel_flg should be set to y or n. In the case of applications at
    750 or 800 MHz and for correlation times in excess of 20 ns the
    sel_flg can be set to no and selection via relaxation should suffice.
 
    At lower field or for smaller molecules set sel_flg == 'y', for
    example at 500 or 600 MHz and for correlation times between 15 and 25ns
    set sel_flg=='y'. We have used sel_flg=='n' for a molecule with a
    correlation time of 43 ns and not observed any residual signal from
    the undesired component.

    This sequence uses the standard three channel configuration
         1)  1H             - carrier (tof) @ 4.7 ppm [H2O]
         2) 13C             - carrier (dof) @ 174 ppm [CO]
         3) 15N             - carrier (dof2)@ 120 ppm [centre of amide 15N]  
    
    Set dm = 'nnn', dmm = 'ccc' 
    Set dm2 = 'nnn', dmm2 = 'ccc'

    Must set phase = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI acquisition in t1
    [CO] and t2 [N].
    For non-VNMR software: The fids must be manipulated (add/subtract) with 
    'grad_sort_nd' program (or equivalent) prior to regular processing.
    
    Flags
        fsat            'y' for presaturation of H2O

        f1180           'y' for 180 deg linear phase correction in F1
                            otherwise 0 deg linear phase correction
        f2180           'y' for 180 deg linear phase coreection in F2

        sel_flg         'y' for small proteins or fields less than 750
                        'n' for high fields and/or larger proteins 
        shared_flg      'y' allows acquisition in F2 for longer than 2bigTN
                            using the shared constant time principle
        nietl_flg       'y' active suppression of anti-trosy with no loss in s/n

	Standard Settings
        fsat='n',fscuba='n',f1180='y',f2180='n',fc180='n'

    
    Set f1180 to y for (-90,180) in C' and f2180 to n for (0,0) in N
    Set the carbon carrier on the C' and use the waveform to pulse the
        c-alpha

    Modified by L.E.Kay on March 3, 1999 to insert C' 90 purge after 15N
    evolution to ensure in case where the N-C' refocussing is not complete
    (2*bigTN < 1/2JNC') that the remaining NxCz' magnetization which
    becomes NHxCz' is not present. This will remove a dispersive contribution
    to the F3 lineshape

  Modified by L.E.Kay on January 30, 2002 to improve the shared constant time

  Modified by L.E.Kay to include the Nietlispach method 
    so that the anti-trosy component is eliminated without setting sel_flg to y

   Usage: nietl_flg == y 

  Calibrate pw_sl, tpwrsl unless sel_flg == y
  pw_sl1, tpwrsl1 used only with nietl_flg == y
