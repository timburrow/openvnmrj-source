  gNhsqctocsynoesyNhsqcA 
   

 3D HSQC-TOCSY-NOESY-HSQC gradient sens enhanced version, with N15 shifts
 in 1st & 2nd indirect dimensions. Applies intraresidue amideNH-alphaCH tocsy,
 then sequential amide NH-NH noesy. Suitable for beta-sheet/extended regions. 
 [Suits selective deuteration, but requires amide & alpha protons]

 optional magic-angle coherence transfer gradients

 Standard features include optional 13C sech/tanh pulse on CO and Cab to
 refocus 13C coupling during t1 and t2; one lobe sinc pulse to put H2O back
 along z (the sinc one-lobe is significantly more selective than gaussian,
 square, or seduce 90 pulses); preservation of H20 along z during t1 and the
 relaxation delays.

        	  CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

    Set dm = 'nnn', dmm = 'ccc' for 15N-only labelled compounds.
    Set C13refocus = 'y'  if also C13-labelled as well.      
    Set dm2 = 'nny', dmm2 = 'ccg/w/p') for N15 decoupling.
    (13C is refocussed in t1 and t2 by 180 degree pulses)

    Must set phase = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI acquisition in
    t1 [N15]  and t2 [N15].
   
    The flag f1180/f2180 should be set to 'y' if t1/t2 is to be started at
    halfdwell time. This will give -90, 180 phasing in f1/f2. If it is set to
    'n' the phasing should be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.  Thus,
    set f1180='n' for (0,0) in 1st 15N dim and f2180='n' for (0,0) in the 2nd
    N15 dim. f1180='y' is ignored if ni=0, and f2180='y' is ignored if ni2=0.

          	  DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF gNhsqctocsynoesyNhsqc.c

         
    1. Obtain a printout of the Philosopy behind the BioPack development,
       and General Instructions using the macro: 
                                      "printon man('BioPack') printoff".
       These Detailed Instructions for gNhsqctocsynoesyNhsqcq may be printed using:
                                      "printon man('gNhsqctocsynoesyNhsqcq') printoff".
             
    2. Apply the setup macro "gNhsqctocsynoesyNhsqc". This loads relevant parameter
       set and also sets ni=0 and phase=1 ready for a 1D spectral check.

    3. Centre H1 frequency on H2O (4.7ppm), C13 frequency on 35ppm, and N15 
       frequency on the amide region (120 ppm).

    4. Pulse and frequency calibrations are as for gNhsqc, or as generally
       used for BioPack.

    6. Splitting of resonances in the 1st or 2nd dimension by C13 coupling in 
       C13-enriched samples can be removed by setting C13refoc='y'.

    7. H2O preservation is achieved according to Kay et al, except that a sinc
       one-lobe selective pulse is used to put H2O back along z.  This is much
       more selective than a hard, Seduce1, or gaussian pulse.  H2O is cycled
       back to z as much as possible during t1 and t2.
