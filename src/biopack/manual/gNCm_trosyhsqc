Simultaneous Detection of Amide and Methyl Correlations Using Time Shared NMR Experiment: Application to Binding Epitope Mapping.
                  J. Biomol NMR,39,97-105 (October 2007)

modified coherence transfer gradients to use gzlvl1/gzlvl2 as in other
BioPack sequences.  GG Palo Alto, Nov 2007

    Set dm = 'nny', dmm = 'ccp', dm2 = 'nnn'

    Set phase = 1,2  for States-TPPI acquisition in t1.

    Nature of methyl selective pulse is determined by setup
    macro (gNCm_hsqc). Default is reburp, but could be changed
    to rsnob by editing macro.
    
   INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF gNCm_trosyhsqc
         
    1. Run gNCm_trosy macro.

    2. Set sw1 (C13) and sw2 (N15). sw1 >= sw2. kappa is calculated automatically.
    3. Processing of simultaneous absorptive phase of 13Cm-Hm and 15N-1H 
       is not possible. Use VnmrJ menus in Process...Process in t1 page.
    4. Refocusing gradients may need to be fine-tuned for optimal performance
       (array gzlvl2 for best NH signal)
