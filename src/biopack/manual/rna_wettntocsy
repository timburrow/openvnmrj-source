     tntocsy - total correlation spectroscopy  (a.k.a. hohaha)
              "clean tocsy" used with windowing and MLEV16+60degree spin lock

    ref: a. bax and d.g. davis, j. magn. reson. 65, 355 (1985)
         m. levitt, r. freeman, and t. frenkiel, j. magn. reson. 47, 328 (1982)

  Parameters:
     window= clean-tocsy window(in us)
        p1 = 90 degree excitation pulse (at power p1lvl)
        pw = 90 degree pulse during mlev periods (at power level tpwr)
    satdly = length of presaturation;
    satmode  = flag for presat control
               'yn' for during relaxation delay 
               'yy' for during both "relaxation delay" and "d2" (recommended)
     phase = 1,2: for HYPERCOMPLEX phase-sensitive F1 quadrature
               3: for TPPI phase-sensitive F1 quadrature
     sspul = 'y':  trim(x)-trim(y) sequence initiates D1 delay
             'n':  normal D1 delay
      trim = spinlock trim pulse time
       mix = mixing time  (can be arrayed)
        nt = min:  multiple of 2
             max:  multiple of 8  (recommended)

           TRANSMITTER MUST BE POSITIONED AT SOLVENT FREQUENCY 
             this pulse sequence requires a T/R switch,
             linear amplifiers and computer-controlled attenuators on the
             observe channel.

	P.A.Keifer - 940916 - fixed d2 timing
	P.A.Keifer 950406 - made wettocsy (std format)
	P.A.Keifer 950920 - updated wet
        P.A.Keifer 960116 - added tpwrf control to Wet4

	Changes for RnaPack by Peter Lukavsky, Stanford, Sept. 1999

        wetpw instead of pwwet
        rlpower changed to obspower
        pw      :	90 degree excitation pulse (at power level tpwr)
        p1      :       90 deg pulse width for spinlock

        reversed above assignment of pw/p1 to be consistent with other
        BioPack usage. GG aug2004
