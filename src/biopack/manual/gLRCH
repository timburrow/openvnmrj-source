  gLRCH

DESCRIPTION and INSTRUCTION:

    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiment:
    3D LRCH for the measurement of long range H-C coupling constants.
    These couplings are useful for sterospecific assignment of CD in Leu.
    ni(t1) --> 1H
    ni2(t2)--> 13C

    OFFSET POSITION:
        tof =   ~4.75 ppm (1H on water).
        tofh = ~2 ppm (Methyl protons)
        dof =  ~30 ppm (13CB of Leu) 
        dof2 =  120 ppm (15N region, not used in this experiment).

    CHOICE OF FLAGS:
    mag_flg = y -> Uses magic angle gradients (Triax PFG probe is required).
    ref_flg = y -> Runs ni2 2D reference experiment (See reference).
    flg_3919 = y -> Uses 3-9-19 water suppression.
    flipback = y -> Activates water flipback.
