    Uses three channels:
         1)  1H             - carrier @ water  
         2) 13C             - carrier @ 35 ppm
         3) 15N             - carrier @ 118 ppm

        1) first rgpulse of a regular 13C-edited NOESY is replaced by a (90H)-180(C,H)
    )-90(C) pulse sandwich that is cycled so that the magnetization from protons connected
    to C13 are cycled out and only the protons connected to C12 are frequency labeled 
    during the t1 period. Subsequently the Hs connected to C12 transfer magnetization to 
    protons connected to C13 and are detected through C13 and H(C13) in the t2 and t3 periods.
 
        2) The protons connected to  15N also transfer magnetization to 13C connected
    protons and are not cycled out. Therefore, this version of the pulsesequence only 
    provides information of the CC region of the spectrum that is inter-chain noes. The C-N
    region however has both intra and interchain information.

    VNMR/VNMRJ processing: set f1coef='1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0' or use wft2d('1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0')


    Set dm = 'nnny', [13C decoupling during acquisition].
    Set dm2 = 'nyny', [15N dec during t1 and acq] 

    Must set phase = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI
    acquisition in t1 [H]  and t2 [C].

    Set f1180 = 'y' and f2180 = 'y' for (-90,180) in F1 and (-90,180) in  F2.    
    c180_flg='y' for HH 2D (ni) experiment (fixed d3 (t2) in this case) 
    c180_flg='n' for carbonyl decoupling using wfg during t2 (3D only)
    Note: Zero order phase correct may not be exactly -90 in F2 due to seduce.

    STUD DECOUPLING.   SET STUD='y':
       Setting the flag STUD='y' overrides the decoupling parameters listed in
       dg2 and applies STUD+ decoupling instead.  In consequence is is easy
       to swap between the decoupling scheme you have been using to STUD+ for
       an easy comparison.  The STUD+ waveforms are calculated for your field
       strength at the time of ProteinPack installation and RF power is 
       calculated within the pulse sequence.  The calculations are for the most 
       peaks being greater than 90% of ideal. If you wish to compare different 
       decoupling schemes, the power level used for STUD+ can be obtained from 
       dps - subtract 3dB from that level to compare to decoupling schemes at
       a continuous RF level such as GARP.  The value of 90% has
       been set to limit sample heating as much as possible.  If you wish to 
       change STUD parameters, for example to increase the quality of decoupling
       (and RF heating) change the 95% level for the centerband
       by changing the relevant number in the macro makeSTUDpp and 
       rerun the macro (don't use 100% !!).  (At the time of writing STUD has
       been coded to use the coarse attenuator, because the fine attenuator
       is not presently included in the fail-safe calculation of decoupling 
       power which aborts an experiment if the power is too high - this may
       lower STUD efficiency a little).

     LP in t2:
       The finite delays necessary during 13C evolution make the first few data
       points in t2 distorted in intensity. The timing is correct so that lp2
       may be set to zero, but the intensity distortion, particularly of the
       second complex point, lead to a "dish" aspect of the baseline. This is not
       due to the presence of a first-order phase correction (lp2), so adjustment
       of the timing of the pulse sequence events is not needed.
   
       The solution to this is to use linear prediction in t2, the 13C dimension.
       In VNMR you can both "fix up" the first few points using the rest of the
       data table as the basis set, as well as extend the data set for better F2
       resolution and less distortion from truncation. The macro "BPsetlp2" can be
       used in the format "BPsetlp2(desired ni2, acquired ni2, #fixed)". Set
       "desired ni2" to be the final extended data size, "acquired ni2" to be the
       total # of increments to be used as a basis (it may be less than ni2, for
       example if the experiment is running), and "#fixed" to the number of
       initial points in t2 to be predicted (typically 2-4). Try this with a 2D
       data set for varying numbers of fixed points until the baseline is sufficiently
       flat in F2.
