 C13dqcosy - double quantum filtered cosy experiment
               with spinecho following dqcosy

  Parameters:

         pw = 90 excitation pulse (at power level tpwr)
         d3 = spinecho time (sec)
      phase =   0: P-type non-phase-sensitive experiment
              1,2: hypercomplex phase-sensitive experiment
                3: TPPI phase-sensitive experiment
      sspul = 'y': selects for Trim(x)-Trim(y)
               sequence at start of pulse sequence
             (highly recommended to eliminate "long T1" artifacts)
