3D/(4D) gNhsqcnoesyNhsqc.c v1.10
    
 3D HSQC-NOESY-HSQC gradient sensitivity enhanced version with amide proton-
 proton NOESY. Attached N15 shifts are in first and second indirect dimension.
 Suitable for NH NH noes in alpha-helical domains and extended regions. 
 [suits full C-H deuteration if available, but requires amide protons]

 In 4D mode (i.e. ni3 > ~24 phase3=1,2) source proton shift is also collected 
 with semi-constant time in an optional 3rd indirectly detected dimension.
 [3rd party processing software is required for 4D processing]

    Standard features include optional 13C sech/tanh pulse on CO and Cab to 
    refocus 13C coupling during t1 and t2; one lobe sinc pulse to put H2O back 
    along z (the sinc one-lobe is significantly more selective than gaussian, 
    square, or seduce 90 pulses); preservation of H20 along z during t1 and the 
    relaxation delays.

    VNMR processing:
    ****************
    use lsfrq=sw2/2 for proper alignment of N15 shifts.

    The first t1 point is distorted because the lack of time for refocussing pulse(s).
    The consequent result is a large baseline offset along F1. This may be corrected via
    dc2d along F1 or by LP. If these methods are insufficient, the fpmult1 parameter
    may be adjusted iteratively to give no baseline offset in F1. This may require a
    negative value of fpmult1 which is currently limited to positive values. This may
    be changed by setlimit('fpmult1',100,-100,.001).     

        	  CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

    Set dm = 'nnn', dmm = 'ccc' for 15N-only labelled compounds.
    Set C13refocus = 'y'  if also C13-labelled as well.      
    Set dm2 = 'nny', dmm2 = 'ccg/w/p') for N15 decoupling.
    (13C is refocussed in t1 and t2 by 180 degree pulses)

    Must set phase = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI acquisition in
    t1 [N15]  and t2 [N15].
   
    The flag f1180/f2180 should be set to 'y' if t1/t2 is to be started at
    halfdwell time. This will give 90, -180 phasing in f1/f2. If it is set to
    'n' the phasing should be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.  Thus,
    set f1180='n' for (0,0) and f2180='n' for (0,0) in N15 dim.  f1180='y' is
    ignored if ni=0, and f2180='y' is ignored if ni2=0. In 4D mode use f3180.

          	  DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF gNhsqcnoesyNhsqc.c

         
    1. Obtain a printout of the Philosopy behind the BioPack development,
       and General Instructions using the macro: 
                                      "printon man('BioPack') printoff".
       These Detailed Instructions for gNhsqcnoesyNhsqcq may be printed using:
                                      "printon man('gNhsqcnoesyNhsqcq') printoff".
             
    2. Apply the setup macro "gNhsqcnoesyNhsqc". This loads relevant parameter
       set and also sets ni=0 and phase=1 ready for a 1D spectral check.

    3. Centre H1 frequency on H2O (4.7ppm), C13 frequency on 100ppm, and N15 
       frequency on the amide region (120 ppm).

    4. Pulse and frequency calibrations are as for gNhsqc, or as generally
       used for BioPack.

    6. Splitting of resonances in the 1st or 2nd dimension by C13 coupling in 
       C13-enriched samples can be removed by setting C13refoc='y'.

    7. H2O preservation is achieved according to Kay et al, except that a sinc
       one-lobe selective pulse is used to put H2O back along z.  This is much
       more selective than a hard, Seduce1, or gaussian pulse.  H2O is cycled
       back to z as much as possible during t1 and t2.
