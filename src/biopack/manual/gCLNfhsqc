   minimum step cycling is 2
   program written by Susumu Mori and Chitrananda Abeygunawardana,Johns Hopkins
   modified for 3rd Channel operation BKJ 970430 
   TROSY option is included. When TROSY is selected use nt=8 (NM, Palo Alto)
   CLEANEX-PM  included by Igor Goljer  09-08-2002
   mix   : mixing time for exchange
   pw180 : 180 degree pulse for CLEANEX-PM mixing time should be 85 us
   gztm  : gradient level used for mixing to suppress radiation dumping
   only the above three variables need to be created to do CLEANEX-PM
   H2Osinc pulse used for selective excitation of water
   
   Modified CLEANEX-FHSQC sequence is written by T.-L. Hwang, based on the original
FHSQC sequence by S. Mori, etc.

   the TROSY phase cycle corrected to pick the correct component and to use the 
   sensitivity enhanced version. The minimum phase cycle for TROSY reduced to 4 steps.
   Corrected the d2 timing in the TROSY version. Added soft watergate option via
   wtg3919 flag.   
   
   Use f1coef = '1 0 -1 0 0 1 0 1' for TROSY

Signal response may be sensitive to 1H calibration. Set mix to ~.15 and  pw180~85. Then array
compH around nominal value for best s/n.
