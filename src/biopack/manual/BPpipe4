     Export NMRpipe processed data to exp
**********************************************

This checkbox sets the parameter BPpipexport='y'.

Following NMRpipe processing, a VnmrJ-compatible
frequency-domain data set will be put into the
workspace specified by the entry box instead of
the current experiment.

Time-domain data and the full parameter set will
also be placed in the specified workspace. Display
and processing parameters will be set to agree
with the NMRpipe-processed data.

This capability is only used when a single data
set is processed.
