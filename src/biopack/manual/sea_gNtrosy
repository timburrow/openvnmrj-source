    2D 1H-15N trosy experiments only on water accessable residues
    for N15- or N15/C13-labeled proteins
       
    For N15/C13-labeled samples, both C13 double filter and spin-echo filter
    can be used to eliminate CH-NH NOE and TOCSY contributions. 
        use C13 double filter by setting 
        C13filter='y' (fact has no effect)
        or use spin-echo filter by setting
        C13filter='n', fact=3 (odd number).     
        
    For N15-labeled samples, only spin-echo filter can be used to eliminate
        CH-NH NOE and TOCSY contributions by setting
        C13filter='n', fact=3 (odd number).
     
         
    H1 frequency on H2O (4.7ppm), 
    N15 frequency on the amide region (~120ppm).  
             
      During the C13 double filter, C13 frequency is on aliphatic region (35ppm),
      then is shifted to (116ppm) for decoupling C13 from  N15
      in N15 t1 evolution.
