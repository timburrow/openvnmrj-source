 wgtocsy - 
   Homonuclear TOCSY with DIPSI spinlock and watergate
   water suppression.


   made C13refoc flag for C13 decoupling in t1.
   15N refocussing done if N15refoc='y'
   Both 13C and 15N refocussing done if CNrefoc='y' 
   Dropped power 3db down for both N15 and 13C if simulaneous 180's.

   Uses composite C13 180s in t1

   Limited bandwidth of C13 180s in t1 favors
   aliphatic-only or aromatic-only tocsys

   if gt2>0 then homospoil gradient and gstab delay put after
   flipback pulse.

   Modified to set spinlock power using fine attenuator. G.Gray Feb2005
