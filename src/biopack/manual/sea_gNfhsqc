 sea_gNfhsqc

        2D 1H-15N fhsqc experiment for on water accessable residues only
        for N15- or N15/C13-labeled proteins
      
        For N15/C13-labeled samples: Both C13 double filter and spin-echo filter
        can be used to eliminate CH-NH NOE and TOCSY contributions. 
        Use C13 double filter by setting 
               C13filter='y' (fact has no effect). 
        or use spin-echo filter by setting
               C13filter='n', fact=3 (odd number).     
        
        For N15-labeled samples, only spin-echo filter can be used to eliminate
        CH-NH NOE and TOCSY contributions by setting
               C13filter='n', fact=3 (odd number).
        
        Set f1180='y' to indentify the folded peaks, 
        then (-90, 180) phase correction in t1 should be made.
       
        Center  H1 frequency on H2O (4.7ppm), 
        N15 frequency on the amide region (~120ppm).  
             
        During the C13 double filter, C13 frequency is in aliphatic region (35ppm),
        then is shifted to (~116ppm) for decoupling Calfa and C=O from amide N
        in N15 t1 evolution.
