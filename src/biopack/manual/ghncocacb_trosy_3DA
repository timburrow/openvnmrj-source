  ghncocacb_trosy_3DA.c
 
    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiment:

     3D hncocacb (Hn,N,Cb) with deuterium decoupling
     and either CT or non-CT (f_CT == y,n) for 13Cb acquisition, 
     It is optimized for fully (100 %) labeled proteins.

     F1    Cbeta (CT if f_CT = y, i-1)
     F2    N + JNH/2 (i)
     F-acq HN - JNH/2 (i)

    This sequence uses the standard four channel configuration
         1)  1H             - carrier @ 4.7 ppm [H2O]
         2) 13C             - carrier @ 43 ppm (CA/CB)
         3) 15N             - carrier @ 120 ppm  
	 4)  2H		    - carrier @ 3 ppm  

    Standard flag settings
	f1180 =   'n'  for (0,0) phase correction in f1.
	f2180 =   'n'  for (0,0) phase correction in f2
	fsat =    'n' fscuba = 'n'. don't saturate water
        sel_flg = 'y' for active purging of the fast component
                = 'n' no active purging; relaxation attenuation of the
                   fast relaxation component
        f_CT    = 'y' for CT evolution of Cb chemical shift 
        c180_flg= 'n' 
        cal_sphase 'y' only for calibration of sphase.
                    set sphase to sphase - 45 check to get no signal.
                    (array for zero signal and add 45o).
                    set eta to a small value, gt12=gt13=gt14=0. 
        shared_CT 'y' for extending the acq in t2 (N15)
	dm = 'nnn'
	dm2 = 'nnn' dmm2 = 'ccc' [NO 15N decoupling during acquisition]
        dm3 = 'nnn' dmm3 = 'ccc'
        ampmode = 'dddp'
	
    Must set phase = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI acquisition in
    t1 [Cb]  and t2 [N]. [The fids must be manipulated (add/subtract) with
    'grad_sort_nd' program (or equivalent) before regular non-VNMR processing.]
    
    Use ampmode = 'dddp'

    Pulse scheme is optimized for completely deuterated samples
 
    Pulse scheme uses TROSY principle in 15N and NH with transfer of
    magnetization achieved using the enhanced sensitivity pfg approach,

    If sel_flg =='n' then the component of interest is not actively
    selected for; relaxation will attenuate the undesired component.
    Selection is achieved during the first N---> 13C' transfer.
 
    In general it is very difficult to present rules indicating when
    sel_flg should be set to y or n. In the case of applications at
    750 or 800 MHz and for correlation times in excess of 20 ns the
    sel_flg can be set to no and selection via relaxation should suffice.
 
    At lower field or for smaller molecules set sel_flg == 'y', for
    example at 500 or 600 MHz and for correlation times between 15 and 25ns
    set sel_flg=='y'. We have used sel_flg=='n' for a molecule with a
    correlation time of 43 ns and not observed any residual signal from
    the undesired component.

   Setup: See Shan et al. JACS, 1996 for details. Note that the expt. can
          be run as non-CT in Cb dimension (see Yamazaki et al. JACS 116,
          11655, 1994 for details).

          The "a" part of the sequence (pulses during this period have
           the suffex a) has the carrier at 174 (C') ppm.
          The "b" part of the sequence (pulses during this period have
           the suffex b) has the carrier at 43 (Ca/Cb) ppm. 

       Define delta as the distance in Hz between 174 (C') and 56 (Ca) ppm
       Define delta1 as the distance in Hz between 174 (C') and 43 (Ca/Cb) ppm

          pwco90a:  C' 90, applied with a stength of delta/sq(15), on res (174).
          pwco180a: C' 180, (seduce), on res (174 ppm).
          pwca180a: Ca 180, strength of delta/sq(3), off resonance
          pwca90b:  Ca/Cb 90,  strength of delta1/sq(15), on res (43 ppm).
          pwca180b: Ca/Cb 180, strength of delta1/sq(3), on res (43 ppm).
            (used only for calibration of sphase).
          pwcreb:   C 180 (reburp), on res (43 ppm).
          pwcgcob:  g3 pulse, inverts C' and Cg of aromatics, off res. 
          pwcgcobi: g3 pulse, inverts C' and Cg of aromatics, off res.
             (this is a time inverted g3 pulse ---> can use pwcgcob instead). 

    Based on hncocacb_CT_D_sel_pfg_600.c

    Modified by L.E.Kay on March 3, 1999 to insert C' 90 purge after 15N
    evolution to ensure in case where the N-C' refocussing is not complete
    (2*bigTN < 1/2JNC') that the remaining NxCz' magnetization which
    becomes NHxCz' is not present. This will remove a dispersive contribution
    to the F3 lineshape   

  Modified by L.E.Kay on Nov. 22, 2001 to include shared CT
  Modified by L.E.Kay on Dec. 6, 2001 to extend phase cycle

  Modified by L.E.Kay to add a nietl_flg so that the anti-trosy
  component is eliminated in an active manner with no less in s/n.
