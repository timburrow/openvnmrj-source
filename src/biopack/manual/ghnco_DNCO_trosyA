ghnco_DNCO_trosyA

    Pulse scheme uses TROSY principle in 15N and NH with transfer of
    magnetization achieved using the enhanced sensitivity pfg approach,

    Yang and Kay, J. Biomol. NMR, January 1999.

    E. COSY principle is used to get Co-N coupling on 15N dimension and 
    Co-NH coupling on proton dimension.
 
    The following expt is:

    3D hnco with trosy(enhanced sensitivity PFG)
    with selective pulses to minimize
    excitation of water
                F1      CO 
                F2      15N + JNH/2 + (Jf+1)*JNCO  (assume JNH is positive)
                F3(acq) 1H (NH) - JNH/2 + JHN-CO

    This sequence uses the standard three channel configuration
         1)  1H             - carrier (tof) @ 4.7 ppm [H2O]
         2) 13C             - carrier (dof) @ 174 ppm [CO]
         3) 15N             - carrier (dof2)@ 120 ppm [centre of amide 15N]  
    
    Set dm = 'nnn', dmm = 'ccc' 
    Set dm2 = 'nnn', dmm2 = 'ccc'

    Must set phase = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI acquisition in t1
    [CO] and t2 [N]. [The fids must be manipulated (add/subtract) with 
    'grad_sort_nd' program (or equivalent) prior to regular processing.]
    
    Flags
        fsat            'y' for presaturation of H2O
        fscuba          'y' for apply scuba pulse after presaturation of H2O
        f1180           'y' for 180 deg linear phase correction in F1
                            otherwise 0 deg linear phase correction
        f2180           'y' for 180 deg linear phase coreection in F2
                            otherwise 0 deg
        fc180           'y' for C180 at t2/2 when checking 15N/NH 2D

        sel_flg         'y' in general 
                        'n' for high fields and/or larger proteins 

	Standard Settings
        fsat='n',fscuba='n',f1180='y',f2180='n',fc180='n'

    
    Set f1180 to y for (-90,180) in C' and f2180 to n for (0,0) in N
    Set the carbon carrier on the C' and use the waveform to pulse the
        c-alpha

    This scheme uses an accordion-based method to 'increase the N-CO 
    couplings at the expense of the effective 15N linewidth.

    The coupling measured in F2 (15N) is the N-Co coupling * (Jf + 1),
    while the linewidth of the 15N line is 1 / [T2/(Jf + 1)]. 

    Must optimize the value of Jf to choose. Use of a value of Jf such
    that the net t2 acq. time, (Jf + 1) * (ni2 - 1)/sw2 is on the order
    of T2 or a bit longer. Example, for a 90 ms T2 (long relaxing trosy
    component) and for a chem. shift acq. time of about 25 ms, use a Jf
    value of 3, for an effective JN-CO of (Jf + 1)*JN-CO.
