"N15 IPAP-hsqc using 3919 watergate suppression 
technique, modified to suppress naturel-abundance 15N 
signals from NH2 groups of polyacrylamide gel"

Ref: J Biomol NMR. 2001 Oct;21(2):141-51.

First tests done by Eric C. seem to indicate a S/N 
reduction near 17% and a good suppression of the gel 
signals, comparatively to the standard Bax sequence. 
Parameters are coming from standard gNhsqc.c and 
have not yet been optimized specifically for this 
sequence. To setup the experiment call the Biopack 
gNhsqc_IPAP macro (i.e. Experiments>>Protein C13/N15 
experiments> N15 coupling measurements> N15 HSQC IPAP). 

Acquisition:
Gel='y' IPAP='n','y' phase=1,2 array='IPAP,phase'
May be usefull to play with d3 (for watergate). 
Excitation of all resonances except those of the 
offset of the carrier and at positions k/d3 
(k is an integer).

Processing:
you can acquire both antiphase and in-phase spectra 
at the same time. To obtain both components with 
the same phase use
  wft2d(1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0)   (in-phase) 
  wft2d(0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0)  (anti-phase)

To look at individual satellites you can also build 
sum and difference of the two data sets:
  wft2d(1,0,0,0,0,0,1.11,0,0,0,1,0,-1.11,0,0,0) sum
  wft2d(1,0,0,0,0,0,-1.11,0,0,0,1,0,1.11,0,0,0) diff

Note the factor of 1.11. You can adjust this value 
to get a good match.

To measure exact signal positions in these component 
spectra, you need line fitting software 
(such as "fitspec" / deconvolution).
