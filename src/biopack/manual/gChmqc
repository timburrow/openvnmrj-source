 gChmqc.c


	This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiment:

    Gradient HMQC for C13 in D2O or in H2O employing wet water suppression. 

	                  CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

    JCH is usually set to the true coupling constant value. The 1/2JCH
    delay is set to 3.57ms (140Hz) as default value and can be changed
    by setting JCH.

    Set dm = 'nny', dmm = 'ccg' for C13 garp1-decoupling.
    Set dm2 = 'nny', dmm2 = 'ccg' for N15 garp1-decoupling.

    Must set phase = 1,2  for States-TPPI acquisition in t1 [N15].

    The initial value of t1 is set to be started at halfdwell time.
    This will give -90, 180 phasing in f1.

    
                  DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF gChmqc

    1. Apply the setup macro "gChmqc".  This loads the relevant parameter set
       and also sets ni=0 and phase=1 ready for a 1D spectral check.

    2. Splitting of resonances in the C13 dimension by N15 coupling in N15
       enriched samples can be removed by setting N15refoc='y'.

    3. Setting of GRADIENTS:

	-G0 not too strong (500us/2G)
	-G1 can be strong for good H2O-suppression (500us/16G)

    4. SETUP: dof is changed automatically
	arom='y'
                        sw=10ppm
                        sw1=30ppm
                        dof=125ppm
                        dof2=120ppm
        aliph='y' 
                        sw=10ppm
                        sw1=90ppm
                        dof=85ppm
                        dof2=200ppm
    5. PROCESSING:  If f1180='n', the first point will be distorted if N15refoc='y'. This
       can be corrected by linear predicting the first point, e.g. use setlp1(512,256,1)
       to extend the data set from 256 to 512 points, while predicting the first point.
       In VNMR, fpmult1 can also be set before the 2D ft to scale the first point of the
       interferrogram.
