  ghc_co_nh_6dA             

    3D H(CCO)NH (or HCCH-TOCSY-NNH) gradient sensitivity enhanced
    Semi-Constant Time version. Allows PR experiments up to 6 dimensions.
    Only 2D experiments are run.

    Correlates all the aliphatic 1H resonances of a given amino acid directly
    with the amide of the next residue.  Uses isotropic 13C mixing and 15N
    constant time evolution. 

    Standard features include maintaining the 13C carrier in the CaCb region
    throughout using off-res SLP pulses; full power square pulses on 13C 
    initially when 13CO excitation is irrelevant; square pulses on the Ca and
    CaCb with first null at 13CO; one lobe sinc pulses on 13CO with first null
    at Ca;  shaka6 composite 180 pulse to simultaneously refocus Ca and invert
    CO; optional 2H decoupling when CaCb magnetization is transverse and during 
    1H shift evolution for 4 channel spectrometers.  
 
    Magic-angle option for coherence transfer gradients.  TROSY option for
    N15/H1 evolution/detection.

        	  CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

    	Set dm = 'nnn', dmm = 'ccc' 
    	Set dm2 = 'nny', dmm2 = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for 15N decoupling.
	Set dm3 = 'nnn' for no 2H decoupling, or
		  'nyn'  and dmm3 = 'cwc' for 2H decoupling. 
  
    Must set = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI acquisition in
    t1 [13C]  and t2 [15N].

    The flag f1180/f2180 should be set to 'y' if t1/t2 is to be started at
    halfdwell time. This will give 90, -180 phasing in f1/f2. If it is set to
    'n' the phasing should be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.  Thus,
    set f1180='n' for (0,0) in 13C and f2180='n' for (0,0) in 15N.  f1180='y' is
    ignored if ni=0, and f2180='y' is ignored if ni2=0.



          	  DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF ghc_co_nhA

    1. Obtain a printout of the Philosopy behind the BioPack development,
       and General Instructions using the macro: 
                                      "printon man('BioPack') printoff".
       These Detailed Instructions for ghc_co_nhA may be printed using:
                                      "printon man('ghc_co_nhA') printoff".
             
    2. Apply the setup macro "ghc_co_nhA".  This loads the relevant parameter set
       and also sets ni=ni2=0 and phase=phase2=1 ready for a 1D spectral check.

    3. The parameter ncyc corresponds to the number of cycles of DIPSI-3 mixing.
       Use ncyc = 2 or 3 usually.  This corresponds to a total mixing time of
       (2 or 3)*6.07*600/sfrq ms.  A DIPSI rf field of 9 kHz for a 600Mhz 
       spectrometer is sufficient to cover 14.4 kHz bandwidth (96ppm) and is
       more than adequate for the CC J's.  Change the value of spinlock if a
       different rf strength is required.

    4. The two C13 180 degree pulses after the DIPSI-3 decoupling have been
       replaced by a single 6-pulse composite dubbed "shaka6" which povides
       near perfect refocusing with no phase roll over the Cab region and
       near perfect inversion over the CO region 18kHz off-resonance provided
       pwC < 20 us in a 600 MHz system.
      
    5. Centre H1 frequency on H2O (4.7ppm), C13 frequency on 46ppm, and N15 
       frequency on the amide region (120 ppm).  The C13 frequency remains at 
       46ppm, ie at CaCb throughout the sequence.

    6. The H1 frequency is NOT shifted to the amide region during the sequence.
       The H1 DIPSI2 decoupling is enterable in Hz via the waltzB1 parameter.

   7.  The parameter phi7cal (listed in dg and dg2) is provided to adjust 
       the phase of the last 90 degree C13 pulse, which is phase-shifted by
       the prior 180 degree pulse on the Ca region and by the use of SLP
       pulses on the CO region. The experimentally determined value of this
       phase is also very sensitive to small timing differences (microseconds)
       between the two theta delays. Check this phase via 1D spectra - maximise
       signal, or for greater accuracy obtain the value for a null and then add 
       or subtract 90 degrees.  The value must be a positive number. It needs to
       be calibrated once only for each spectrometer and the gc_co_nh and 
       gcbca_co_nh pulse sequences if you forget to do so.

   8.  tauCH (1.7 ms) and timeTN (14 ms) were determined for alphalytic protease
       and are listed in dg2 for possible readjustment by the user.

   9.  The coherence-transfer gradients using power levels
       gzlvl1 and gzlvl2 may be either z or magic-angle gradients. For the
       latter, a proper /vnmr/imaging/gradtable entry must be present and
       syscoil must contain the value of this entry (name of gradtable). The
       amplitude of the gzlvl1 and gzlvl2 should be lower than for a z axis
       probe to have the x and y gradient levels within the 32k range. For
       any value, a dps display (using power display) shows the x,y and z
       dac values. These must be <=32k.

   10. TROSY:
       Set TROSY='y' and dm2='nnn' for a TROSY spectrum of the bottom right
       peak of the 2D coupled NH quartet (high-field H1, low-field N15).  The 
       TROSY spectrum gives 50% S/N compared to the decoupled spectrum for a 
       small peptide.  To select any of the other three peaks of the 2D coupled
       quartet, in a clockwise direction from bottom right, change t4/t10
       from x/y to x/-y to -x/-y to -x/y.  NOTE, the phases of the SE train
       are almost the same as those determined for the gNhsqc sequence.  The
       major difference is that kappa is eliminated compared to normal
       ghc_co_nhA so the N15 magnetization has not evolved with respect to the 
       attached H's.  I.e. the N15 state would be Ix rather than IySz if there 
       was no coherence gradient - this imparts a 90 degree shift so t8 is 
       changed to y (from x in the normal spectrum).  Also gzlvl1 is after the
       180 N15 pulse rather than before as in gNhsqc, so the sign of icosel 
       and the t4/t10 phase2 increments are also swapped compared to gNhsqc.  

   11. The autocal and checkofs flags are generated automatically in Pbox_bio.h
       If these flags do not exist in the parameter set, they are automatically 
       set to 'y' - yes. In order to change their default values, create the  
       flag(s) in your parameter set and change them as required. 
       The available options for the checkofs flag are: 'y' (yes) and 'n' (no). 
       The offset (tof, dof, dof2 and dof3) checks can be switched off  
       individually by setting the corresponding argument to zero (0.0).
       For the autocal flag the available options are: 'y' (yes - by default), 
       'q' (quiet mode - suppress Pbox output), 'r' (read from file, no new  
       shapes are created), 's' (semi-automatic mode - allows access to user  
       defined parameters) and 'n' (no - use full manual setup, equivalent to 
       the original code). 
    
       When autocal<>'n':
       the spinlock waveform is selectable via the "mixpat" parameter.
       Pbox uses the "spinlock" parameter to calculate the
       attenuator setting. From this it creates the proper waveform to give a
       spinlock field strength of "spinlock" Hz, and sets the proper decspinlock
       parameters.

       When autocal is 'n':
        For mixpat='n': The hardcoded DIPSI3 sequence is  used and the user only enters
        the spinlock field strength (spinlock) and the number of cycles. The mix time is
        derived from these and is visible in the PulseSequence.xml VnmrJ page.

        For mixpat=a name, the user supplies all parameters.

       defined parameters) and 'n' (no - use full manual setup, equivalent to 
       the original code). If autocal<>'n' Pbox creates the desired spinlock
       waveform using the "mixpat" scheme and sets all the relevant decspinlock
       arguments. If autocal='n' the user-entered parameters are used.
