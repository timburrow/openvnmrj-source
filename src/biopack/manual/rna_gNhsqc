        	  CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

    Set dm = 'nny', dmm = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for C13 decoupling.
    Set dm2 = 'nny', dmm2 = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for N15 decoupling.

    Must set phase = 1,2  for States-TPPI acquisition in t1 [N15].
    
    The flag f1180 should be set to 'y' if t1 is to be started at halfdwell
    time. This will give -90, 180 phasing in f1. If it is set to 'n' the 
    phasing should be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.  Thus,
    set f1180='n' for (0,0) in N15.  f1180='y' is ignored if ni=0.



          	  DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF rna_gNhsqc

         
    1. Obtain a printout of the Philosopy behind the RnaPack development,
       and General Instructions using the macro: 
                                      "printon man('RnaPack') printoff".
       These Detailed Instructions for rna_gNhsqc may be printed using:
                                      "printon man('rna_gNhsqc') printoff".
             
    2. Apply the setup macro "rna_gNhsqc".  This loads the relevant parameter set
       and also sets ni=0 and phase=1 ready for a 1D spectral check.

    3. Centre H1 frequency on H2O (4.7ppm), C13 frequency on 110ppm, and N15 
       frequency on the aromatic N region (200 ppm).

    4. CALIBRATION OF pw AND pwN:
       calN and calH are multipliers of the first N15 and H1 90 degree pulses
       in the sequence.  They can be used to calibrate the pulses using a 1D
       spectrum.  Setting either calN or calH = 2.0 should give a S/N null (or 
       small dispersion signals) corresponding to the pulses being set at 180
       degrees.  Adjust pwN or pw, respectively, until this occurs.  An array
       of calH or calN = 1.8, 2.0, 2.2 is also convenient to judge the null at
       2.0.  calN and calH are automatically reset to 1 for 2D spectra if you   
       forget to do so.
    
    5. CHOICE OF N15 REGION:
       amino='y' gives a spectrum of amino resonances centered on dof2=85ppm.
       This is a common usage.                               Set sw1 to 40ppm.

       imino='y' gives a spectrum of imino groups.  dof2 is shifted
       automatically by the pulse sequence code to 155ppm.  Set sw1 to 25ppm.

    6. Splitting of resonances in the N15 dimension by C13 coupling in C13
       enriched samples can be removed by setting C13refoc='y'.

    7. H2O preservation is achieved according to Kay et al, except that a sinc
       one-lobe selective pulse is used to put H2O back along z.  This is much
       more selective than a hard, Seduce1, or gaussian pulse.  H2O is cycled
       back to z as much as possible during t1, and during the relaxation
       delays for the following relaxation time measurements.

    8. T1 MEASUREMENTS OF NH GROUPS:
       Implemented automatically by setting the flag T1='y'.  An array of 1D
       or 2D spectra is obtained by arraying the relaxation time parameter,
       relaxT, to a multiple of 10 milliseconds.  relaxT corresponds
       exactly to the relaxation time of the N15 spins.  The method uses 180
       degree H1 pulses every 5ms during relaxT as according to Kay et al.

   10. T1rho MEASUREMENTS OF NH GROUPS:
       Implemented by setting the flag T1rho='y' and arraying relaxT as above.
       relaxT corresponds exactly to the relaxation time of the N15 spins.
       Spin lock power is limited to 1.5 kHz for a 600 Mhz spectrometer as
       this delivers about the same sample heating as the T2 method below.
       Increasing this RF (by changing the number 1500 in the DECLARE AND LOAD  
       VARIABLES section of rna_gNhsqc.c) causes substantial sample or coil heating 
       as indicated by deterioration of the lock signal).  Care should be taken
       for relaxT times greater than 0.25 seconds, and times greater than
       0.5 seconds are automatically aborted.  Gives very similar results
       to the T2 method as determined using alphalytic protease.  A dummy
       period of spinlock RF is delivered at the beginning of each pulse
       sequence to ensure constant average sample heating - the code
       determines this from the maximum relaxT you have set in your array of 
       relaxT.  If T1rho measurements are to be made in different experiments 
       with different relaxTs, including arrays of relaxT's, set the parameter 
       maxrelaxT to the maximum relaxT you have set in all experiments - this 
       will ensure constant average sample heating in all experiments.  
       maxrelaxT does not need to be set for a single array in a single exp.   
       The spectrum at relaxT=0 may be erroneous because of insufficient 
       dephasing of unlocked spins.

   11. T2 MEASUREMENTS OF NH GROUPS:
       Implemented by setting the flag T2='y' and arraying relaxT as above.
       relaxT corresponds exactly to the relaxation time of the N15 spins.
       As for T1rho, care should be taken for relaxT times greater than 0.25
       seconds, and times greater than 0.5 seconds are automatically aborted.
       The method is according to Kay et al, with N15 180's every 625 us, and
       H1 180's every 10 ms.  625us was used instead of approx 500us used by
       Kay et al to reduce sample heating. A dummy period of N15
       180's is delivered at the beginning of each pulse sequence to ensure 
       constant average sample heating.  Set maxrelaxT as discussed in point
       10. 

   12. Amino GROUPS:
       A spectrum of amino groups, with NH groups cancelled, can be obtained
       with flag amino='y'.  This utilises a 1/2J (J=95Hz) period of NH 
       J-coupling evolution added to t1 which cancels NH resonances and 
       inverts amino resonances (normal INEPT behaviour).  A 180 degree phase
       shift is added to a N15 90 pulse to provide positive amino signals.
       The amino resonances will be smaller (say 80%) than when amino='n'.

   13. RELAXATION MEASUREMENTS OF AMINO GROUPS:
       AMINO resonances are supressed for the methods described in points 9-11.
       To obtain relaxation times of amino groups, set the flag amino='y' and
       proceed as for points 9-11.  In these cases the 1/2J delays described
       in points 8 and 12 are changed to 1/4J delays by the pulse sequence
       code.  Although NH groups are completely cancelled in point 12, when 
       measuring relaxation times NH groups appear at 50% intensity.
