           Multi-frequency saturation(mfsat='y')
 *********************************************************************** 

 Multi-frequence saturation is done by first "clearing" the list of
 frequencies ("clear" button) and then placing the cursor on the lines
 to be saturated, followed by selecting the "Add Frequency" button. This
 creates a file (mfpresat.ll) in the current experiment. All lines will
 be saturated in the selected delays at power satpwr.
 Pbox creates a (saturation) shape "mfpresat.DEC" in the local shapelib.
 The buttons run the command mfll:
     mfll('new') initializes/clears the line list
     mfll reads the current cursor position into
     the mfpresat.ll line list that is created in the
     current experiment. 

 Note: copying pars or fids (mp or mf) from one exp to another does not copy
       mfpresat.ll!
 Note: the line list is limited to 128 frequencies !
