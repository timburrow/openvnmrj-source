    hmcmcgcbcaA
    ===========

    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following
    experiment:

    3D CT transfer from Cm to Cb to Ca for Val 
                   from Cm to Cg to Cb to Ca for Ile and Leu
       Use for deuterated samples
	  	F1     13Cb,a 
               	F2     13Cm
               	F3(acq) 1Hm

    Uses three channels:
    For proteins:
         1)  1H             - carrier @ 4.7 ppm [H2O]
         2) 13C             - carrier @ 40 ppm 


    Set dm = 'nnny', dmm = 'cccp' [13C decoupling during acquisition].
    Set dm2 = 'nnnn', dmm2 = 'cccc' 

    Must set phase = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI
    acquisition in t1 [H]  and t2 [C].

    Set f1180 = 'y' and f2180 = 'n' for (0,0) in F1 and F2.    

    Apply 3 ms (8.125 ppm) reburp pulses centered at 16 ppm to refocus the Cb-Cg2 Ile couplings

    Must reverse the spectrum in F1.
