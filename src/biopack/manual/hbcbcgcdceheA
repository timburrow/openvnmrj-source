  hbcbcgcdceheA.c - auto-calibrated version of the original sequence
       hbcbcgcdcehe_aro_pfg_500a.c


    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiment:

    2D correlation of cb and hd, he of aromatic residues though JCC.
                       F1        CB
                       F2(acq)   HD and HE of aromatic

    Uses two channels:
         1)  1H             - carrier (tof) @ 4.7 ppm [H2O]
         2) 13C             - carrier dof @ 35 ppm shift to dofaro @ 125 ppm
                              (The centre of F1 is 35ppm (dof))

    Set dm = 'nny', dmm = 'ccp' [13C decoupling during acquisition].
    Set dm2 = 'nnn', dmm2 = 'ccc' 

    Must set phase = 1,2 for States-TPPI acquisition in t1 [cb].

    Flags
         fsat      'y' for presaturation of H2O
         fscuba    'y' to apply scuba pulse after presaturation of H2O
         mess_flg  'y' for 1H (H2O) purging before relaxtion delay
         f1180     'y' for 180deg linear phase correction in F1
                       otherwise 0deg linear phase correction in F1

    Standard Settings 
                       fsat='n', fscuba='n', mess_flg='y', f1180='n'
    
    The flag f1180 should be set to 'y' if t1 is 
    to be started at halfdwell time. This will give -90, 180
    phasing in f1. If it is set to 'n' the phasing will
    be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.
