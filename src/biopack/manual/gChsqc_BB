 gChsqc_BB 

    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiment:

                 13C-HSQC with sensitivity enhancement,
                 broadband 13C coverage (Methyls to Aromatics) 
                 inspired by Shaka's papers
                 JMR v136 p54  1999
                 JMR v151 p269 2001

  SOME CARE TAKEN TO ACCOUNT FOR "INOVA-TYPE" HIDDEN DELAYS (POWER_DELAY, etc.)

  In uniformly C13 labeled samples,
  there is a possibility of CA->HB and CB->HA correlations in this HSQC,
  especially with high s/n experiments.
  This is a price one pays for having SE enhancement and Jcc scalar couplings.
   On the other hand, water suppression is good
   and the whole C13 range can be covered in one spectrum.


        	  CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

    Set dm = 'nny', dmm = 'ccp'  for C13 decoupling.
    
    Must set phase = 1,2  for States-TPPI acquisition in t1
