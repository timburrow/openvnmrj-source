 cyclenoef. Difference NOE experiment
      Uses the obs xmtr for irradiation and fine power control
  Parameters:

    pw - 90 degree excitation pulse (at power tpwr)
    intsub - 'y': internal subtraction of data acquired by on-resonance
                  and off-resonance selective excitation
             'n': data acquired by on-resonance and off-resonance selec-
                  tive excitation are stored separately
    noefrq  - frequency of selective saturation (on resonance);
              (make this an array if intsub = 'n', off-res dof if cycle='n')
    control - off resonance selective saturation frequency
              (an inactive parameter if intsub = 'n')
    cycle   - cycle='y' does on-resonance saturation using frequency cycling
              around the frequency "noefrq" given by "spacing"and"pattern" 
              cycle='n' does off-resonance saturation at control
    spacing - spacing(in Hz) of multiplet
    pattern - pattern type ( 1 for singlet, 2 for doublet, etc.)    
    tau     - period spent on a single irradiation point during cycling 
    noepwr  - power of selective irradiation
   finepwr  - extra attenuation (4095=no atten. 0=60db additonal atten.)
    noetime - total length of irradiation at frequency noefrq.
    mix - mixing time
    sspul   - sspul='y' hs-90-hs before d1
    nt - intsub = 'n':  multiple of 16
         intsub = 'y':  multiple of 32
    shaped-   flag to select shaped-pulse saturation (no cycling)
    shape-    selective pulse shape used for saturation (at noepwr/noetime)
