With IPAP='n','y' phase=1,2 array='IPAP,phase'
you can acquire both antiphase and in-phase spectra at the same time. To
obtain both components with the same phase use
        wft2d(1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0,0)     for in-phase signals
        wft2d(0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0)      for anti-phase signals

To look at individual satellites you can also build sum and difference of
the two data sets:
        wft2d(1,0,0,0,0,0,1.11,0,0,0,-1,0,1.11,0,0,0)       sum
        wft2d(1,0,0,0,0,0,-1.11,0,0,0,-1,0,-1.11,0,0,0)     difference

Note the factor of 1.11. You can adjust this value to get good match.

To measure exact signal positions in these component spectra, you need
line fitting software (such as "fitspec" / deconvolution).
