  ghc_co_nhP.c               

    3D H(CCO)NH (or HCCH-TOCSY-NNH) gradient sensitivity enhanced version.


    Correlates all the aliphatic 1H resonances of a given amino acid directly
    with the amide of the next residue.  Uses isotropic 13C mixing and 15N
    constant time evolution. 

    Standard features include maintaining the 13C carrier in the CaCb region
    throughout using off-res SLP pulses; full power square pulses on 13C 
    initially when 13CO excitation is irrelevant; square pulses on the Ca and
    CaCb with first null at 13CO; one lobe sinc pulses on 13CO with first null
    at Ca;  shaka6 composite 180 pulse to simultaneously refocus Ca and invert
    CO; optional 2H decoupling when CaCb magnetization is transverse and during 
    1H shift evolution for 4 channel spectrometers.  
 
    Magic-angle option for coherence transfer gradients.  TROSY option for
    N15/H1 evolution/detection.

        	  CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

    	Set dm = 'nnn', dmm = 'ccc' 
    	Set dm2 = 'nny', dmm2 = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for 15N decoupling.
	Set dm3 = 'nnn' for no 2H decoupling, or
		  'nyn'  and dmm3 = 'cwc' for 2H decoupling. 
  
    Must set = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI acquisition in
    t1 [13C]  and t2 [15N].

    The flag f1180/f2180 should be set to 'y' if t1/t2 is to be started at
    halfdwell time. This will give -90, 180 phasing in f1/f2. If it is set to
    'n' the phasing should be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.  Thus,
    set f1180='n' for (0,0) in 13C and f2180='n' for (0,0) in 15N.  f1180='y' is
    ignored if ni=0, and f2180='y' is ignored if ni2=0.



          	  DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF ghc_co_nhP

    1. Obtain a printout of the Philosopy behind the BioPack development,
       and General Instructions using the macro: 
                                      "printon man('BioPack') printoff".
       These Detailed Instructions for ghc_co_nhP may be printed using:
                                      "printon man('ghc_co_nhP') printoff".
             
    2. Apply the setup macro "ghc_co_nhP".  This loads the relevant parameter set
       and also sets ni=ni2=0 and phase=phase2=1 ready for a 1D spectral check.

    3. The parameter ncyc corresponds to the number of cycles of DIPSI-3 mixing.
       Use ncyc = 2 or 3 usually.  This corresponds to a total mixing time of
       (2 or 3)*6.07*600/sfrq ms.  A DIPSI rf field of 9 kHz at 600Mhz 
       will cover 14.4 kHz of spectral width (96 ppm) and is 
       more than adequate for the CC J's.  The 9 kHz is achieved by setting 
       the spinlock parameter to 9000.  Change the spinlock variable for different
       magnetic fields or applications. The c13decouple statement has a factor of
       two included to make the DIPSI3 work as a mixing scheme rather than for decoupling.
       The bandwidth value is specified in the new shapelib file after go or dps.

    4. The two C13 180 degree pulses after the DIPSI-3 decoupling have been
       replaced by a single 6-pulse composite dubbed "shaka6" which povides
       near perfect refocusing with no phase roll over the Cab region and
       near perfect inversion over the CO region 18kHz off-resonance provided
       pwC < 20 us in a 600 MHz system.
      
    5. Center H1 frequency on H2O (4.7ppm), C13 on 174ppm, and N15 frequency
       on the amide region (120ppm). The C13 frequency is calculated in the
       sequence to be at 46ppm, ie at Cab throughout the sequence.

    6. The H1 frequency is NOT shifted to the amide region during the sequence.
       The H1 DIPSI2 decoupling is controlled by the waltzB1 strength.
       The new value is specified in the new shapelib file after go or dps.  

   7.  The parameter phi7cal (listed in dg and dg2) is provided to adjust 
       the phase of the last 90 degree C13 pulse, which is phase-shifted by
       the prior 180 degree pulse on the Ca region and by the use of SLP
       pulses on the CO region. The experimentally determined value of this
       phase is also very sensitive to small timing differences (microseconds)
       between the two theta delays. Check this phase via 1D spectra - maximise
       signal, or for greater accuracy obtain the value for a null and then add 
       or subtract 90 degrees.  The value must be a positive number. It needs to
       be calibrated once only for each spectrometer and the gc_co_nhP .  The 
       value is the same for gc_co_nhP and gcbca_co_nhP. It will be different
       from the value for gc_co_nh and gcbca_co_nh.

   8.  tauCH (1.7 ms) and timeTN (14 ms) were determined for alphalytic protease
       and are listed in dg2 for possible readjustment by the user.

   9.  The coherence-transfer gradients using power levels
       gzlvl1 and gzlvl2 may be either z or magic-angle gradients. For the
       latter, a proper /vnmr/imaging/gradtable entry must be present and
       syscoil must contain the value of this entry (name of gradtable). The
       amplitude of the gzlvl1 and gzlvl2 should be lower than for a z axis
       probe to have the x and y gradient levels within the 32k range. For
       any value, a dps display (using power display) shows the x,y and z
       dac values. These must be <=32k.

   10. TROSY:
       Set TROSY='y' and dm2='nnn' for a TROSY spectrum of the bottom right
       peak of the 2D coupled NH quartet (high-field H1, low-field N15).  The 
       TROSY spectrum gives 50% S/N compared to the decoupled spectrum for a 
       small peptide.  To select any of the other three peaks of the 2D coupled
       quartet, in a clockwise direction from bottom right, change t4/t10
       from x/y to x/-y to -x/-y to -x/y.  NOTE, the phases of the SE train
       are almost the same as those determined for the gNhsqc sequence.  The
       major difference is that kappa is eliminated compared to normal
       ghc_co_nhP so the N15 magnetization has not evolved with respect to the 
       attached H's.  I.e. the N15 state would be Ix rather than IySz if there 
       was no coherence gradient - this imparts a 90 degree shift so t8 is 
       changed to y (from x in the normal spectrum).  Also gzlvl1 is after the
       180 N15 pulse rather than before as in gNhsqc, so the sign of icosel 
       and the t4/t10 phase2 increments are also swapped compared to gNhsqc.     
  11.  The N15 t2 evolution and the sensitivity enhancement train is common
       to all g...._nh sequences and the pulse sequence code for these final
       sections is in the include file, bionmr.h.
