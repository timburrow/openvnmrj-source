                      "and optional HH homodecoupling in t2"

   step cycling is 8; Ref: JMR v131, 373-378 (1998)


With IPAP='n','y' phase=1,2 array='IPAP,phase'
you can acquire both antiphase and in-phase spectra at the same time. To
obtain both components with the same phase use
        wft2d(1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0,0)     for in-phase signals
        wft2d(0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0)      for anti-phase signals

To look at individual satellites you can also build sum and difference of
the two data sets:
        wft2d(1,0,0,0,0,0,1.11,0,0,0,-1,0,1.11,0,0,0)       sum
        wft2d(1,0,0,0,0,0,-1.11,0,0,0,-1,0,-1.11,0,0,0)     difference

Note the factor of 1.11. You can adjust this value to get good match.

To measure exact signal positions in these component spectra, you need
line fitting software (such as "fitspec" / deconvolution).

   Modified by Eriks Kupce on 17.05.2002 :
   Added soft watergate option and homo-decoupling, fixed phase cycling;   
   
   HH homo-decoupling:
   ===================
   Activated by setting the Hdecflg='y'. The dsp flag should be set to 'n'.
   The decoupling waveform is created automatically at the 'go' (or 'dps') time.
   Recommended Cdecflg='y' - use low power WURST-40 decoupling for long range 
   C-H couplings. The decoupling waveform is created automatically at the 'go' 
   (or 'dps') time.                
   Note - complete de-phasing of water is the key requirement for obtaining good
   quality spectra with HH homo-decoupling !!! This may reduce the overall 
   in proteins with fast exchanging NH groups. Note also that the selective 
   pulses in watergate are not affected by Radiation Damping.  
   The residual signal from water is eliminated by phase cycling and hence the
   spectra will improve with increasing ss and nt.                   
   The power levels for HH and CH decoupling can be changed by setting Hdecpwr
   and Cdecpwr to non-zero values. If Hdecpwr=0 or Cdecpwr=0, the calculated 
   values will be used.
   Due to the Bloch-Siegert effects the alfa delay can be relatively large and 
   negative.
   The effect from HH homo-decoupling is best appreciated, if the HH coupling
   is resolved. This usually requires a fairly long acquisition time (at >= 0.1s)
   a good digital resolution (fn >= 4k) and a sensible window function. For the
   purpose of comparison the HH decoupling can be switched off by Hdecflg='off'.
   The resolution is further improved by using C-13 decoupling during acquisition. 
   This is best achieved using low-power WURST-40 decoupling designed for long 
   range CH decoupling (set Cdecflg = 'y').
