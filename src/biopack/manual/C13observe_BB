     spinecho option following s2pul
     p1 and pw pulses are at pwClvl power level
     spinecho pulse is shp_pw at power shp_pwr/shp_pwrf

     Coil ringing and acoustic ringing requires delay before
     acquisition, particularly for cold probes (200-400 usec). This
     is done here by using a double spin-echo.
