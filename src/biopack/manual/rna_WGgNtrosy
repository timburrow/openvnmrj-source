 rna_WGgNtrosy
       This pulse sequence will allow one to perform trosy experiment(Ref.Pervushin
	et al.  PNAS, 94,12366,1997)
       
       Both cos and sin modulated magnetization(i.e. Nx and Ny)  were obtained. 

	Standard setting: bottom-right
           F1      15N + JNH/2 (J>0)
           F2(acq)  1H - JNH/2 (NH)

    This sequence uses the standard three channel configuration
         1)  1H             - carrier (tof) @ 4.7 ppm [H2O]
         2) 13C             - carrier (dof) @ 160 ppm [centre of arom C13]
         3) 15N             - carrier (dof2)@ 119 ppm [centre of imino N15]

			NOTE: dof must be set at 110ppm always
                        NOTE: dof2 must be set at 200ppm always

    Set dm = 'nnn', dmm = 'ccc'
    Set dm2 = 'nnn', dmm2 = 'ccc'

    Must set phase = 1,2.
    The fids must be manipulated
    (add/subtract) with 'grad_sort_nd' program (or equivalent, see below) prior to
    regular processing.

   Based on L.E.Kay on July 28, 1998

   Modified by Peter Lukavsky for RnaPack; included peak selection.
   For RDC measurment use the downfield N15 doublet (bottom) and
   the upfield (right) and downfield (left) H1 component, since these are the
   most intense peaks of the multiplet in large RNAs.
   For RNAs in the range of 30-100kDa, we commonly use
   taua=taub=0.00153 and d1=0.8sec
   For processing use f1coef='1 0 -1 0 0 1 0 1'
