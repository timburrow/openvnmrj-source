            2D cross relaxation experiment.  It can be performed in
            either phase-sensitive or absolute value mode.  Either
            TPPI or the hypercomplex method can be used to achieve
            F1 quadrature in a phase-sensitive presentation.  No
            attempt is made to suppress J-cross peaks in this pulse
            sequence.

           WET suppression available in relaxation delay and/or mix period
           gradients can suppress radiation damping in t1 and/or mix period
 
           "Quiet" option for suppression of spin-diffusion (requires
           labelled compound)

  Parameters:

       mix = mixing time.
     phase =   0: gives non-phase-sensitive experiment (P-type peaks);
                  nt(min) = multiple of 16
                  nt(max) = multiple of 64

             1,2: gives HYPERCOMPLEX phase-sensitive experiment;
               3: gives TPPI phase-sensitive experiment;
                  nt(min) = multiple of  8
                  nt(max) = multiple of 32

      pwN,pwNlvl   pw90 for N15 on channel 3 at power level pwNlvl
      pwC,pwClvl   pw90 for C13 on channel 2 at power level pwClvl
  Cquiet OR Nquiet  set='y' for "quiet" option (suppresses spin-diffusion caused
                     noesy cross peaks in labelled samples)
             wet   set to 'yn' for wet in relaxation delay
                          'ny' for wet in mix period
                          'yy' for both
                          'nn' for neither


    c13ref='y' selects  "stC200"  adiabadic inversion pulse (BioPack), otherwise
               2.0*pwC is used
      wet pulses may be different in relaxation and mix (could have multisite
          suppression in mix period with longer pulses)
