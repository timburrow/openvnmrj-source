   Use Semi-constant time in CO dimension so that more increments
   can be used in the CO dimension.  Maximun ni is set to 64.

   When sw1 = 2000, the value of ratio at different ni is:
   ni    = 64,   48,   32,   24,   14 (minimum value)
   ratio = 0.38, 0.50, 0.76, 1.01, 1.74

   if the calculated value is larger than 1.0, it will be set to 1.0.
   Semi-constant time evolution is used when ratio is smaller than 1.0
   Constant time evolution is used when ratio is 1.0.

   Recommended value: ratio = 0.5 to 1.0.

   3D experiment correlates HN(i), N(i) and CO (both i and i-1).

    Uses three(four) channels:
         1)  1H   (t3)       - carrier  4.7 ppm (tof)
         2) 13CO  (t1, ni)   - carrier  174 ppm  (dof)
                               SLP pulses are used for CA
         3) 15N   (t2, ni2)  - carrier  120 ppm (dof2) 
         4) 2H               - at lock frequency

    The waltz16 field strength is enterable (waltzB1).
    Typical values would be ~6-8ppm, (3500-5000 Hz at 600 MHz).

   The autocal and checkofs flags are generated automatically in Pbox_bio.h
   If these flags do not exist in the parameter set, they are automatically 
   set to 'y' - yes. In order to change their default values, create the flag(s) 
   in your parameter set and change them as required. 
   The available options for the checkofs flag are: 'y' (yes) and 'n' (no). 
   The offset (tof, dof, dof2 and dof3) checks can be switched off individually 
   by setting the corresponding argument to zero (0.0).
   For the autocal flag the available options are: 'y' (yes - by default), 
   'q' (quiet mode - suppress Pbox output), 'r' (read from file, no new shapes 
   are created), 's' (semi-automatic mode - allows access to user defined 
   parameters) and 'n' (no - use full manual setup, equivalent to the original code).
