  hmcmcgcbcacoA.c - based on hmcmcgcbcaco_lek_800_v2.c

    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following
    experiment:

    3D CT transfer from Cm to Cb to Ca to CO for Val 
                   from Cm to Cg to Cb to Ca to CO for Ile and Leu
       Use for deuterated samples
	  	F1     13CO 
               	F2     13Cm
               	F3(acq) 1Hm

    Uses three channels:
    For proteins:
         1)  1H             - carrier @ 4.7 ppm [H2O]
         2) 13C             - carrier @ 94 ppm 


    Set dm = 'nny', dmm = 'ccp' [13C decoupling during acquisition].
    Set dm2 = 'nnn', dmm2 = 'ccc' 

    Must set phase = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI
    acquisition in t1 [H]  and t2 [C].

    Set f1180 = 'y' and f2180 = 'n' for (0,0) in F1 and F2.    

    Apply 3 ms reburp pulses centered at 16 ppm to refocus the Cb-Cg2 Ile couplings
    Sit at 40 ppm, then jump to 176 then back to 40 ppm

      rb180   = reb_on.RF  (300 us)
      rb180_co = reb_136p.RF (300 us)
      rb180_cg  = reb_-26p.RF (3 ms, 800 MHz)
