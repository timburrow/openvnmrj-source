/*  rna_CTgChmqc.c

    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiment:

    2D CT-HMQC or CT-HTQC experiment with optional N15 refocusing, options 
    for C13 decoupling and editing of spectral regions.

                      NOTE dof MUST BE SET AT 110ppm ALWAYS
                      NOTE dof2 MUST BE SET AT 200ppm ALWAYS


    pulse sequence: 	Marino et al, JACS, 114, 10663 (1992)
     

        	  CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

    Set dm = 'nny', dmm = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for C13 decoupling.
    Set dm2 = 'nny', dmm2 = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for N15 decoupling.

    Must set phase = 1,2  for States-TPPI acquisition in t1 [N15].
    
    The flag f1180 should be set to 'y' if t1 is to be started at halfdwell
    time. This will give -90, 180 phasing in f1. If it is set to 'n' the 
    phasing should be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.  Thus,
    set f1180='n' for (0,0) in N15.  f1180='y' is ignored if ni=0.



          	  DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF rna_CTgChmqc

         
    1. Obtain a printout of the Philosopy behind the RnaPack development,
       and General Instructions using the macro: 
                                      "printon man('RnaPack') printoff".
       These Detailed Instructions for rna_CTgChmqc.c may be printed using:
                                      "printon man('rna_CTgChmqc') printoff".
             
    2. Apply the setup macro "rna_CTgChmqc".  This loads the relevant parameter set
       and also sets ni=0 and phase=1 ready for a 1D spectral check.

    3. Centre H1 frequency on H2O (4.7ppm), C13 frequency on 110ppm, and N15 
       frequency on the aromatic N region (200 ppm).

    4. CHOICE OF C13 REGION and CTdelay:
       ribose='y' gives a spectrum of ribose/C5 resonances centered on dof=85ppm.
       Set CTdelay to 1/35Hz to 1/40Hz.			Set sw1 to 60ppm.

       aromatic='y' gives a spectrum of aromatic C2/C6/C8 groups.  dof is shifted
       automatically by the pulse sequence code to 145ppm.
       Set CTdelay to 1/70Hz to 1/80Hz.			Set sw1 to 30ppm.

       allC='y' gives a spectrum of ribose and aromatic resonances. dof is
       set by the code to 110ppm.                           
       Set CTdelay to 1/35Hz to 1/40Hz.			Set sw1 to 110ppm.

    5. N15 COUPLING:
       Splitting of resonances in the C13 dimension by N15 coupling in N15
       enriched samples is removed by setting N15refoc='y'.  No N15 RF is
       delivered in the pulse sequence if N15refoc='n'.  N15 parameters are
       listed in dg2.

    6. 1/4J DELAY TIMES:
       These are listed in dg/dg2 for possible change by the user. JCH is used
       to calculate the 1/4J time (lambda=0.94*1/4J) for H1 CH coupling evolution.
       Lambda is calculated a little lower (0.94) than the theoretical time to
       minimize relaxation. So for:
         ribose CH/CH2:           JCH=145Hz
         aromatic CH:             JCH=180Hz
         allC:                    JCH=160Hz

    7. SPECTRAL EDITING FOR DIFFERENT CHn GROUPS.
       CH2only='y' provides spectra of just CH2 groups by setting lambda to 1/2J
       to generate triple and single quantum coherence.

    8. STUD DECOUPLING.   SET STUD='y':
       Setting the flag STUD='y' overrides the decoupling parameters listed in
       dg2 and applies STUD+ decoupling instead.  In consequence it is easy
       to swap between the decoupling scheme you have been using to STUD+ for
       an easy comparison.  The STUD+ waveforms are calculated for your field
       strength at the time of RnaPack installation and RF power is
       calculated within the pulse sequence.  The calculations are for the most
       efficient conditions to cover 140ppm when allC='y' with all decoupled
       peaks being greater than 85% of ideal; 80ppm/90% for ribose='y' and
       aromatic='y'.  If you wish to compare different
       decoupling schemes, the power level used for STUD+ can be obtained from
       dps - subtract 3dB from that level to compare to decoupling schemes at
       a continuous RF level such as GARP.  The values of 85, 90, and 95% have
       been set to limit sample heating as much as possible.  If you wish to
       change STUD parameters, for example to increase the quality of decoupling
       (and RF heating) for 30ppm decoupling say, change the 95% level for the
       centerband, by changing the relevant number in the macro makeSTUDpp and
       rerun the macro (don't use 100% !!).  (At the time of writing STUD has
       been coded to use the coarse attenuator, because the fine attenuator
       is not presently included in the fail-safe calculation of decoupling
       power which aborts an experiment if the power is too high - this may
       lower STUD efficiency a little).
