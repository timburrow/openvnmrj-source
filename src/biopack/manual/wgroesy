wgroesy- rotating frame NOE experiment with T-Roesy modification
                allows T-Roesy or standard cw Roesy
                allows 3919 and softpulse WATERGATE 

             OBSERVE TRANSMITTER SHOULD BE SET AT SOLVENT POSITION
             SATURATION,SPIN LOCK AND PULSES ALL USE OBS.XMTR

        p1 = 90 degree pulse on protons (power level at "p1lvl")
        pw = 90 degree spin lock pulse at tpwr (active only if T_flg='y')
     p1lvl = power level for the p1 pulse
      tpwr = power level for the spin lock pulse(s)
      p180 = 2*p1 @ p1lvl (180degrees pulse in softpulse watergate)
    flippw = long pulse on water during echo
    flippwr= power for flippw
   phincr2 = small angle phase shift for p2
  flag3919 = 'y' switches to 3919 watergate ('n' gives softpulse watergate)
        d3 = interpulse delay in 3919 watergate (zero excitation for n*1/d3 [kHz])
     T_flg= 'y' gives pulsed T-Roesy; 'n': cw Roesy
     phase = 1,2: F1 quadrature by the hypercomplex method
       mix = mixing time
     sspul = 'y': activates gradient-90degree-gradient pulse prior to d1    
        nt = min:  multiple of 4; max:  multiple of 8
