                 1H homonuclear decoupling"

   minimum step cycling is 2
   program written by Susumu Mori and Chitrananda Abeygunawardana,Johns Hopkins
   modified for 3rd Channel operation BKJ 970430 
   TROSY option is included. When TROSY is selected use nt=8
   
   Modified by Eriks Kupce :
   the TROSY phase cycle corrected to pick the correct component and to use the 
   sensitivity enhanced version. The minimum phase cycle for TROSY reduced to 4 steps.
   Corrected the d2 timing in the TROSY version. Added soft watergate option;   
   Use f1coef = '1 0 -1 0 0 1 0 1' for TROSY

   HH homo-decoupling:
   ===================
   Activated by setting the Hdecflg='y'. The dsp flag should be set to 'n'.
   The decoupling waveform is created automatically at the 'go' (or 'dps') time.

   Note - complete de-phasing of water is the key requirement for obtaining good
   quality spectra with HH homo-decoupling !!! This may reduce the overall s/n 
   in proteins with fast exchanging NH groups. Note also that the selective 
   pulses in watergate are not affected by Radiation Damping.  
   The residual signal from water is eliminated by phase cycling and hence the
   spectra will improve with increasing ss and nt.                   
   The power level for decoupling can be changed by setting Hdecpwr to a non-zero value.
   This may be necessary to improve water suppression.
   If Hdecpwr=0, the Pbox-calculated value will be used.

   Due to the Bloch-Siegert effects the alfa delay can be relatively large and 
   negative.

   The effect from HH homo-decoupling is greatest when the HH coupling
   is resolved. This usually requires a fairly long acquisition time (at >= 0.1s)
   a good digital resolution (fn >= 4k) and a sensible window function. For the
   purpose of comparison the HH decoupling can be switched off by Hdecflg='off'.
   This uses the same (explicit acquisition) pulse sequence but without decoupling.
   This is different from Hdecflg='n' where the sequence reverts to the normal
   gNfhsqc without explicit acquisition.

   CH decoupling:
   ==============
   Resolution is improved by using C-13 decoupling during acquisition. 
   This is best achieved using low-power WURST-40 decoupling designed for long 
   range CH decoupling (set Cdecflg = 'y'). 

   The power level for decoupling can be changed by setting Cdecpwr to a non-zero value.
   If Cdecpwr=0, the Pbox-calculated value will be used.

   The decoupling waveform is created automatically at the 'go' or 'dps' time.
