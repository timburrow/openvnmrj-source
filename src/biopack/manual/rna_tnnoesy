/* tnnoesy -  2D cross relaxation experiment.  It can be performed in
            either phase-sensitive or absolute value mode.  Either
            TPPI or the hypercomplex method can be used to achieve
            F1 quadrature in a phase-sensitive presentation.  No
            attempt is made to suppress J-cross peaks in this pulse
            sequence.
                TRANSMITTER SOLVENT SATURATION ONLY
                ASSUMES ON-RESONANCE SOLVENT (tof is at solvent position)

   satmode  determines when the saturation happens. Satmode should be set
            analogously to dm, i.e. satmode='yyyn' or 'ynyn' etc.
               satmode='yyyn' recommended
    satdly = length of presaturation period (saturation may also occur in d2 and mix
              as determined by satmode)
     sspul = 'y': selects for Trim(x)-Trim(y) sequence at start of pulse sequence
