 rna_11noesy

   1-1 echo NOESY (coded by Marco Tonelli @ NMRFAM)
   Sklenar and Bax (1987) JMR 74 pg. 469.

   maxHz : maximum of excitation profile in Hz (from tof) 
	   it is used to calculate echo delay: echo = 1.0/(maxHz*4.0)-(pw*0.667)

   gzlvl1 : gradients to control water magnetization during t1 evolution (use low value)
   gstab  : recovery delay after gradients

   tof    : frequency for the H1 direct dimension (MUST be set to H2O).
   tof1   : frequency for the H1 indirect dimension (if different from H2O). 
	    For RNA samples it may be convenient to set the offset for the 1H indirect 
	    dimension in between the imino and aromatic peaks and then reduce the indirect 
	    spectral window to ~13ppm (vs. ~24ppm for the direct dimension).
	    If tof1 parameter does not exists create it in vnmr with the command:
		create('tof1','frequency')
	    then set it to the desired value. 
	    If no frequency shift is needed, do not create this parameter (if it doesn't
	    exist) or if it does exist set it to the same value as tof.

            *****************************************************************************
	    PLEASE NOTE: if tof1 exists and is different from tof, the indirect dimension 
			 frequency will be shifted to the tof1 value
			 if you do NOT want this to happen, either destroy the parameter 
			 tof1 in vnmr using the command:
					destroy("tof1")
                         or set tof1=tof (and remember to do this if you change tof).
