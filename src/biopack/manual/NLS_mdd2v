Conversion of MDD data into VnmrJ-compatible data:
==================================================
This permits use of VnmrJ processing, display and
plotting of MDD-processed NLS data acquired using VnmrJ. 
The converted data is presented as time-domain data with 
linear t1 and t2 incrementation to t1max and t2max 
specified by the selection of nimax and ni2max prior to 
data acquisition. No change in t3 processing parameters 
is possible, but t1 and t2 processing parameters may be 
selected as if the data were acquired in a normal linear 
sampling manner. Normal 3D processing using standard 
VnmrJ commands and panel "widgets" is used.

A) from VnmrJ.
================
Select "Convert MDD Data for VnmrJ Processing" from the 
"Options" menu on the Acquire/Sampling page. To view this 
page setup the same experiment via the Experiments drop-down 
menu. Then select the Orekhov method in the "Select Indirect 
Dimension Sampling" page in the Acquire folder. This will
then show the "Options" menu.

Enter the full path name of the MDD data file and the 
destination file name and directory for the VnmrJ-compatible 
data file.

Click the "Process" button to produce the file.

Use the ordinary VnmrJ browser,Future Actions Page or command 
line to retrieve this data file into the current experiment. 
The ni/ni2 values will reflect the increment numbers used for 
the "Max. Increments for Linear Sampling Case" when the data 
were acquired (shown when the "Set/View Acquisition Parameters" 
option is selected), not the "Increment multipliers"

The processing generates a log file in the VnmrJ fid file and 
this may be viewed in the Text Output window by using the 
"Show Results of Data Conversion in Text Window" button.

Macros
=======

   BP_mdd2v('filename.fid','myfid.fid')
   
   The mdd-processed data file filename.fid/fid.m2v is converted 
   into a VnmrJ-accessible format and stored in a user specified 
   filename, myfid.fid The mdd2v.log file shows the progress of 
   the processing.
   
   Note that in the new file, myfid.fid the processing parameters 
   in the directly detected (np) dimension have been disabled and 
   no zero filling, phasing, referencing or window functions should 
   be used in the subsequent ft3d processing.
 
   All these functions should be applied prior to the VnmrJ to 
   MDD dataconversion. The indirectly detected dimensions are 
   processed as desired.
       
B) from a shell.
================
   convert the mdd data file into a Varian format using the 
   following command:
   
   > mdd2v filename.fid myfid.fid
   
   The myfid.fid file is now ready for the conventional 3D 
   processing as described above.
