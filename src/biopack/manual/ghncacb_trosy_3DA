  ghncacb_trosy_3DA.c - auto-calibrated version of the original sequence

    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiment:

    3D hncacb with deuterium decoupling - Optimized for fully deuterated samples
	F1	Cbeta  (CT,if f_CT == 'y')
	F2	N + JNH/2
	F-acq	HN - JNH/2

   If f_CT == 'y' this is the TROSY version of hncacb_CT_D_sel_pfg_600.c 
    Shan et al., JACS 118, 6570 (1996).
   If f_CT == 'n' this is the TROSY version of hncacb_D_sel_pfg_600_v2.c
    Yamazaki et al. JACS 116, 11655 (1994).
 
    This sequence uses the four channel configuration:
         1)  1H             - carrier @ 4.7 ppm [H2O]
         2) 13C             - carrier @ 43 ppm (CA/CB)
         3) 15N             - carrier @ 120 ppm  
         4)  2H             - carrier @ 3 ppm

    Set dm = 'nnn', dmm = 'ccc' 
    Set dm2 = 'nnn', dmm2 = 'ccc' [NO 15N decoupling during acquition !!]
    Set dm3 = 'nnn', dmm3 = 'ccc'

    Must set phase = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI acquisition in
    t1 [Cb]  and t2 [N]. [The fids must be manipulated (add/subtract) with
    'grad_sort_nd' program (or equivalent) prior to regular processing.]

        sel_flg         'y' for active purging of the fast relaxing component

        c180_flg        'n' for the 3D 
        cal_sphase      'y' only for calibration of sphase.
                         set sphase to sphase -45 check to get no signal
                         (array for zero signal and add 45o)

                         for callibration of sphase
        shared_CT        'y' for shared CT in 15N dimension (if t2 acq > CT period

    Pulse scheme is optimized for completely deuterated samples
	

    Pulse scheme uses TROSY principle in 15N and NH with transfer of
    magnetization achieved using the enhanced sensitivity pfg approach,

    If sel_flg =='n' then the component of interest is not actively
    selected for; relaxation will attenuate the undesired component.
    Selection is achieved during the first N---> 13C' transfer.

    In general it is very difficult to present rules indicating when
    sel_flg should be set to y or n. In the case of applications at
    750 or 800 MHz and for correlation times in excess of 20 ns the
    sel_flg can be set to no and selection via relaxation should suffice.

    At lower field or for smaller molecules set sel_flg == 'y', for
    example at 500 or 600 MHz and for correlation times between 15 and 25ns
    set sel_flg=='y'. We have used sel_flg=='n' for a molecule with a
    correlation time of 43 ns and not observed any residual signal from
    the undesired component.

    Setup: Define Delta as the difference in Hz. between C' (174 ppm) and
               Ca (56 ppm).
           Define Delta1 as the difference in Hz. between C' (174 ppm) and
               Ca/Cb (43 ppm).
           pwca90: 12 us C 90 or shorter, on res, (43 ppm).
           pwcreb: Reburp pulse, on res, (43 ppm).
           pwcgcob: G3 inversion at 150 ppm to inverted aromatics and C', off
                    res.
                    shcgcob is the waveform for the non-time inverted pulse.
                    shcgcobi is the waveform for the time inverted pulse.
                    (can both be the same).
           pwca180: Ca 180 pulse using a power of delta/sq(3), off res and
                    centered at 58 ppm (15 ppm shift from carrier at 43 ppm).
           pwco180: C' 180 pulse, phase modulated by 133 ppm so that
                    excitation is at 176 ppm, but with null at 58 ppm. NB:
                    Use a delta/sq(3) pulse width !!!, not a delta1/sq(3), 
                    since the null is at 58 ppm.

     Modified by L.E.Kay on March 3, 1999 to include Ca purge immediately
     after the 15N CT period

     Modified by L.E.Kay on November 7, 2001 to include shared_CT

     Modified by L.E.Kay on November 30, 2001 to extend the phase cycle to include
      cycle of 15N 90 prior to t2. Can still use an 8 step cycle

     Modified by L.E.Kay to include a nietl_flg to suppress the anti-TROSY
      component so that there is no need to use sel_flg == y

     Modified by G.Gray  for BioPack, Feb 2005

     Calibrate pw_sl, tpwrsl  unless sel_flg == y
     Calibrate pw_sl1, tpwrsl1 - used only if nietl_flg == y
