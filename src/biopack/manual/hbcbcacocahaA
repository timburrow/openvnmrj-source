 hbcbcacocahaA: Autocalibrated (Automatic Pbox) version of the Kay sequence:
        hbcbcacocaha_3c_pfg1+_500a.c 


    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiment:

    3D correlation of cb, ca and ha and have separation with c'.
                        F1      CB, CA
                        F2      CO
                        F3(acq) HA

    Uses three channels:
         1)  1H        - carrier (tof) @ 4.7 ppm [H2O]
         2) 13C        - carrier (dofcacb @ 43ppm/ dof 54ppm) [CA/CB then CA]
                                 (The centre of F1 is 43ppm (dofcacb))
         3) 15N        - carrier (dof2) @ 119 ppm [centre of amide N] 


    Set dm = 'nny', dmm = 'ccp' [13C decoupling during acquisition].
    Set dm2 = 'nnn', dmm2 = 'ccc' [15N decoupling during t2 done using
                                       N 180 pulse]

    Must set phase = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI acquisition in
    t1 [carbon]  and t2 [C'].
  
    Flags
         fsat      'y' for presaturation of H2O
         fscuba    'y' to apply scuba pulse after presaturation
         mess_flg  'y' for H2O purging in the middle of sequence
         f1180     'y' for 180deg linear phase correction in F1
                       otherwise 0deg linear phase correction in F1
         f2180     'y' for 180deg linear phase correction in F2
         c180_flg  'y' for c' 180 at t2/2 when recording F1,F3 2D

    Standard Settings
         fsat='n', fscuba='n', mess_flg='y', f1180='n', f2180='y', c180_flg='n'

    The flag f1180 should be set to 'y' if t1 is to be started at half
    dwell time. This will give -90, 180 phasing in f1. If it is set to 'n'
    the phasing will be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.
    The flag f2180 should always be set to 'y' to give -90,180 in the C'
    dimension

    a pulses are all at 43 ppm; b pulses are at 54 ppm. The C' 180 shape
    is seduce for a pulses and rectangular for b pulses.

    To test the sequence set c180_flg='y', but set to n before you start 3D
    Set pwca90a to ~57 us
        pwca180a to ~ 51 us
        pwco180a = 254 us (seduce shape)
    
        pwca90b = 62 us
        pwca180b = 55.5 us

        decouple using a 100-120 us pulse

    Modified by L.E.K on Aug 22/93 to improve the sequence.
    This is a three channel expt. Does not involve seduce decoupling

    To be compatible with the Inova system:
    - Added 2us delays between obspower and pulse statements (RM Jan 6/97)
    and added 4us delay on either side of the shaped C180 when c180_flg='y'
    (RM & LEK  Jan 7/97).

    REF: L. E. Kay    J. Am. Chem. Soc. 115, 2055-2057 (1993).

    Modified by L.E.Kay on Dec. 30, 1999 to add small angle phase shift
     and an additional phase cycling step

    Added parameter waltzB1 to permit user definition of 1H decoupling field (autocal!='n')
    Modified sequence to convert to current use (no TODEV,DODEV, DO2DEV)
      and replaced rlgradient statements with zgradpulse statements.  GG apr03
