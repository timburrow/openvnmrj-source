ghNcaNH_A
 
   hNcaNH with double-TROSY feature
   Use for 2H-13C-15N labeled proteins. 

  Correlations: 
   t1(ni)   : N[i],N[i-1],N[i+1]
   t2(ni2)  : N[i]
   t3(np/at): HN[i]

  Depending upon tmeCN and size of the protein: 
    [default] timeCN 14-16ms    auto-peak N[i] has different sign than cross-peaks N[i +/-1] 
              timeCN 20-24ms    auto-peak N[i] almost absent, cross-peaks have larger intensity
   
   Sensitivity is about 2/3 of HNCACB experiment
             (See Supplementary for  hNCAnh experiment paper)

   This is an "A" style of the pulse sequence programming: 
      all shaped pulses (except proton) are generated automatically on-the-flight by Pbox calls,
      right before experiment starts. User needs to have only three reference (calibration)
      parameters per channel: pw90, pw90 power level and compression factor (see BioPack manual)

   For any automatically generated shaped pulse,shape parameters are determined by a single
   "Pbox input string parameter" (see Pbox manual).
   
     Example: 180-degree shaped pulse on CO while sitting on CA will be  
              determined by "Pbox input string" parameter 
              
              CO180offCA_in_str = 'gaus 60p 120p 0 0 180', i.e.
              Gaussian shape, covering 60ppm, offset by 120ppm,
              spin state 0, pulse phase 0, flip angle on resonance 180 degrees.

     NOTE: due to this particular pulse sequence implementation peculiarities,  
           arraying  string parameter "whatever_pulse_in_str" will not work:
           experiment will run with whatever_pulse_in_str = first-element-of-array 

   SOME CARE TAKEN FOR INOVA-TYPE AP DELAYS; NOT TESTED ON INOVA SYSTEMS
   
    
    exp_mode='t' for trosy in the double-trosy hNcaNH

    exp_mode='R' to check signal in 1D and test relaxation losses during 2*timeCN  (~2*16ms=32ms) transfers
    
    set dm3='nyn' for deuterium decoupling on CA during 2*timeCN transfer


 How to set up:

  1a)  Set exp_mode='R', timeCN=0.0001 (=100us), run 1D expriment
  1b)  Set exp_mode='R', timeCN=0.0001 (=100us),
       array  gzlvl6 (coherence-selection decoding gradient) for max transfer efficiency
       at this stage, 1D sensitivity should be almost the same as regular TROSY-HNCA


  1c) [recommended,  can result in up to 5-10% signal-to-noise increase, depending on console/amplifier vintage.]

      Check whether there is a need to account for a small phase shift due to different power levels used for 
      shaped 180 pulse on CA and hard 13C pw90.

      Set exp_mode='R', timeCN=0.0001 (=100us),
      Record several 1Ds with slightly different phases 
      for the shaped 180-degree pulse  on CA in the middle of  2*timeCN period:
      
       Example:

        -> run 1D with  CA180n_in_str = 'q3 18p  0  0 0 180' 
           (shaped 180-degree q3 pulse on CA covering 18ppm  with no small phase shift) 
            note 1D intensity, call it "I0" 

        -> run 1D with  CA180n_in_str = 'q3 18p  0  0 10 180' 
            (shaped 180 on CA pulse with 10degree small phase shift) note 1D intensity, call it "I+"

        -> run 1D with -10degree small shift, call it "I-"

           Chose whatever gives better S/N 
       
        NOTE: due to this particular pulse sequence implementation peculiarities,  
              arraying string parameter "CA180n_in_str" will not work:
              experiment will run with CA180n_in_str = first-element-of-array 

  2a) [optional] Check 2H decoupler efficiency

      Set exp_mode='R', timeCN=0.016, dm3='nnn','nyn'. Run arrayed 1D 
      There should be a noticable difference between 2H-decouled and coupled spectra.


  2b) [optional] Check relaxation during 2*timeCN
      Set exp_mode='R',  array timeCN=0.0001, 0.003, 0.006 ... up to 0.025 (25ms)
      Run this arrayed 1D to get an idea of CA* R2*.
      That would help to choose timeCN, see supplemetary for the original paper. 
      Typical timeCN starting value for a large protein with CA* R2*=40 1/s is about 16-20ms
  

  3) set exp_mode='t', timeCN around 16ms, dm3='nyn' and run as 3D with normal (linear)
     sampling or with NUS (Non-Uniform Sampling, recommended)

  timeTN1 = first N[i]-> Ca[i,i-1] tranfer 11-13ms, 1/(4*JNCa)          (12.4ms)
  timeCN  = Ca[i,i-1]-> N[i,i+1,i-1] transfer, 16-25ms          
  timeTN  = last NCa->N transfer, shortened by 1/(4JHN) = timeTN1-tauNH (10ms)
