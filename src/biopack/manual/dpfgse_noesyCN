dpfgse_noesyCN -   NOESY experiment with water suppression by gradient echo.
                    with optional ZQ artifact suppression during mixing  
                    and C13 and/or N15 decoupling for labeled samples

Parameters:
        sspul       - flag for optional GRD-90-GRD steady-state sequence
        gt0         - gradient duration for sspul
        gzlvl0      - gradient power for sspul
	mix	    - mixing time 
        zqflg	    - flap for optional ZQ artifact suppression
	gt1	    - gradient duration for the HS pulse during mix
	gzlvl1	    - gradient power for the HS pulse during mix
        flipback    - flag for an optional selective 90 flipback pulse
                                on the solvent to keep it along z all time
        flipshape   - shape of the selective pulse for flipback='y'
        flippw      - pulse width of the selective pulse for flipback='y'
        flippwr     - power level of the selective pulse for flipback='y'
        flippwrf    - fine power for flipshape by default it is 2048
                        may need optimization with fixed flippw and flippwr
        phincr1     - small angle phase shift between the hard and the
                            selective pulse for flipback='y' (1 deg. steps)
                            to be optimized for best result
        wrefshape   - shape file of the 180 deg. selective refocussing pulse
                        on the solvent (may be convoluted for 
				multiple solvents)
        wrefpw     - pulse width for wrefshape (as given by Pbox)
        wrefpwr    - power level for wrefshape (as given by Pbox) 
        wrefpwrf   - fine power for wrefshape
                      by default it is 2048 needs optimization for
                      multiple solvent with fixed wrefpw suppression only
        gt2        - gradient duration for the solvent suppression echo
        gzlvl2     - gradient power for the solvent suppression echo
        alt_grd    - flag for alternating gradient sign in mix-dpfgse segment
        gstab      - gradient stabilization delay
        C13refoc   - flag for C13 decoupling in F1
        pwC        - 90 deg. C13 pulse for F1-C13 decoupling
        pwClvl     - C13 power level for pwC
        N15refoc   - flag for N15 decoupling in F1 (using 3rd channel)
        pwN        - 90 deg. N15 pulse for F1-N15 decoupling
        pwNlvl     - N15 power level for pwN
        CNrefoc    - flag for simultaneous C13 and N15 dec. in F1
                     (for safety reasons both power levels are automatically
                      droped by 3dB for the simultaneous pulses and 
                      the corresponding pulse widths (pwC and pwN) are also 
                      internaly corrected)
       F2 decoupling is set by the ususal decupling parameters 
                     (adiabatic decouplings schemes are recommended)

Warning: The sequence requires minimum 2 low-band decoupler channels
         for C13 and N15 respectively
