 noesyCA_750.c   auto-calibrated version of noesy_C_chirp_purge_lek_v3a.c (D2O,750MHz) 

    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiment:

    3D noesy from unlabeled to labeled (13C) in D2O. Note the corresponding
        expt. for water samples is noesy_NC_chirp_purge_lek_500.c
	
	purging and INEPT transfer is achieved by carbon CHIRP inversion pulses
	well-suited for D2O-SAMPLES!!

                       F1      1H
                       F2      13C
                       F3(acq) 1H

    NOTE: cnoesy_3c_sed_pfg(1).c 3D C13 edited NOESYs with separation via the
          carbon of the origination site. (D2O experiments)

    Uses three channels:
         1)  1H             - carrier @ water  
         2) 13C             - carrier @ 67 ppm 
         3) 15N             - carrier @ 119ppm [centre of amide N]


    Set dm = 'nny', dmm = 'ccp' [13C decoupling during acquisition].
    Set dm2 = 'nnn', dmm2 = 'ccc' 

    Must set phase = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI acquisition in
    t1 [H]  and t2 [C and N].
  
    Flags
         fsat       'y' for presaturation of H2O
         fscuba     'y' to apply scuba pulse after presaturation of H2O
         mess_flg   'y' for 1H (H2O) purging pulse before relaxation delay
         f1180      'y' for 180deg linear phase correction in F1
                        otherwise 0deg linear phase correction
         f2180      'y' for 180deg linear phase correction in F2
         c180_flg   'y' when recording F1,F3 2D.

    Standard Settings:
       fsat='n', fscuba='n', mess_flg='y', f1180='y', f2180='y'
       c180_flg='n'
         

    Set f1180 = 'y' and f2180 = 'y' for (-90,180) in F1 and (-90,180) in  F2.   
    Note: Zero order phase correct may not be exactly -90 in F2 due to seduce.

    Modified by L. E. Kay on March 6, 1995 to include 15N purging

    Modified by L.E.Kay on April 2, 1996 to include additional N purging

    Modified by R.Konrat on May, 1996 to include CHIRP pulses,
	 (improves INEPT transfer &  B1-sensitivity)

	NOTE: CHIRP-inversion is achieved using the decoupler (decprgon)

	PROGRAM: apod_chirp_dec creates the necessary .DEC-shape
                 (only for non-autocalibrated mode (autocal='n'))

  Please check with the paper for details concerning the construction
      of the pulses for your specific field (different adiabatic pulse
      lengths are used at different magnetic fields)

   Adiabatic pulses are used for both purging and the INEPT transfers
     from 1H ----> 13C and from 13C ----> 1H. 
 
    Example: For Purging for labeled protein/unlabeled peptide
       Carbon carrier is placed at 67 ppm throughout the expt. The center
       of the adiapatic pulse (purging) is at 0 ppm and covers a sweep of
       60 KHz (centered about 0 ppm). I recommend a taua delay of 2.1ms
       and a sweep rate of 2.980 *107 Hz/s and a adiabatic pulse width of
       2.013 ms. We have also optimized a taua of 2.0 ms and a sweep
       rate of 3.729*107Hz/s with a width of 1.609 ms. (600 MHz) Note that
       different rates are needed for different fields. 
 
       apod_chirp_dec 2013 1000 -40090.0 60000.0 20 0 1 
 
       will generate a pulse of 2.013 ms with 1000 steps starting
       -40090 Hz from 67 ppm (ie, 30 KHz downfield of 0 ppm) with a
       sweep of 60 KHz and the first 20% and last 20% of the pulse
       is multiplied by a sine funtion.
 
       For the adiabatic pulses used for the INEPT transfers we use pulses
       of duration 500 us and a 60 KHz sweep centered at 0 ppm for protein/
       peptide work.
 
       Note: Optmized taua/pw_chirp and rates must be employed.
 
       Use a 5 KHz field for chirp

    Modified by  L. E. Kay on Nov 27, 1996 to allow for fast chirps for the inept
     transfers

   Modified by C. Zwahlen & S. Vincent on March 18, 1997, to allow two
   two different chirps for purging


       The autocal flag is generated automatically in Pbox_bio.h
       If this flag does not exist in the parameter set, it is automatically 
       set to 'y' - yes. In order to change the default value, create the  
       flag in your parameter set and change as required. 
       For the autocal flag the available options are: 'y' (yes - by default), 
       and 'n' (no - use full manual setup, equivalent to 
       the original code).  E.Kupce, Varian
