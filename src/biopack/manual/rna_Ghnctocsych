    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiment:

    Base-correlation from Guanine-imino to H8 with options for the initial
    H->N transfer.

                  CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

    Set dm = 'nny', dmm = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for 13C decoupling.
    Set dm2 = 'nny', dmm2 = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for 15N decoupling.

    Must set phase = 1,2  for States-TPPI acquisition in t1 [H1].

    The flag f1180 should be set to 'y' if t1 is to be started at halfdwell
    time. This will give -90, 180 phasing in f1. If it is set to 'n' the
    phasing should be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.  Thus,
    set f1180='n' for (0,0) in H1.  f1180='y' is ignored if ni=0.



                  DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF rna_Ghnctocsych


    1. Obtain a printout of the Philosopy behind the RnaPack development,
       and General Instructions using the macro:
                                      "printon man('RnaPack') printoff".
       These Detailed Instructions for rna_gChsqc may be printed using:
                                      "printon man('rna_Ghnctocsych') printoff".

    2. Apply the setup macro "rna_Ghnctocsych". This loads the relevant
       parameter set and also sets ni=0 and phase=1 ready for a 1D spectral check.

    3. Centre H1 frequency on H2O (4.7ppm), N15 frequency on the aromatic N
       region (200 ppm), and C13 frequency on 110ppm.

    4. CHOICE of transfer:

       CP='y' uses CP for imino H1 -> N15 transfer.
       ncyc_hn should be set to 1 or 2 according to J(H-N) = 95Hz.

       CPMG='y' uses CPMG for imino H1 -> N15 transfer.
       ncyc should be set to 16 or 24.

       INEPT='y' uses INEPT for imino H1 -> N15 transfer.

       ncyc_nc should be set to 3 according to J(N1-C2/C6) = 20Hz.
       ncyc_cc should be set to 11 according to J(C-C) = 12Hz.


       INEPT is generally the best for imino.           Set sw1 to 4ppm.
       A S/N of 3 is generally sufficient for this 2D experiment. Check
       by typing: ft dc getsn.

    5. C13 COUPLING:
       Splitting of resonances in the t1 dimension by C13 coupling
       is removed by setting C13refoc='y' (only for CP transfer; not needed).

    6. GRADIENTS:
       G3 and G4 should be optimized for sufficient water suppression.
       Typical values are G3=12G/cm and G4:-28G/cm.

       G5 and G0 should be 2-3G/cm.

       Gr suppresses radiation damping during t1 and should be 0.5 G/cm.

       In general, gradient-levels should be as low as possible.

    7. pw11-flag:

       Setting of pw11='y' replaces the first off-resonance proton pulse by
       an off resonance 1-1 type proton excitation pulse. This minimizes the
       excitation of H2O and allows to use lower gradient levels.
       Overall, setting pw11='y' leads to a slight loss in S/N.
