Echo/Antiecho gradient selection
uses double low-pass J-filtering for suppression of one-bond correlations
(default is 1st+2nd order filter suppression)

Modified for BioPack, October 2008, GG Varian Palo Alto

SETUP INFORMATION
Using decoupler channel 1 for 13C-pulses
Flags:
lpjf   		Order of initial low pass J-filter (LPJF)
	1: 	1st order LPJF (default)
	2:	2nd order LPJF
	3:	3rd order LPJF 
	4:	4th order LPJF
mboblpjf   	Order of terminal low pass J-filter 
	1: 	1st order LPJF 
	2:	2nd order LPJF (default)
	3:	3rd order LPJF 


satmode	y:	presaturation during relaxation delay
	n:	no presaturation during relaxation delay
MRC	y:	experiment schemes as in Nyberg, N.T. & Sørensen O.W.,

Pulses, Powers & Frequencies:
pw	90 degrees transmitter
pwC	90 degrees decoupler 1
pwlvl	90 degrees transmitter hard pulse power level
pwClvl	power level for decoupler 1 high power
tpwr    transmitter high power level
satpwr	power level for saturation of solvent signal using transmitter 
	during relaxation delay 
satdly	presaturation delay duration (use d1 for total relaxation delay )
satfrq	presaturation offset

Coupling constants
Jmin	smallest 1J(13CH) for LPJF setting
Jmax	largest 1J(13CH) for LPJF setting
jnch 	Long-range coupling used to determing delay for the evolution 
        of long range coupling constants

Gradient settings
gt1 	length of the gradients used ca. 1msec
gzlvl1  max size of the low pass filter gradients.
gzlvl2  gradient for Echo/AntiEcho selection


Processing:

with f1coef='1 0 -1 0 0 1 0 1'

If F1 axis is upside down change the sign of last four f1coefs.
