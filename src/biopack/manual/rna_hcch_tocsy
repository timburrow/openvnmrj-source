/*  rna_hcch_tocsy.c               

    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following
    experiment:

    3D HCCH-TOCSY utilising gradients but not coherence gradients.

    Correlates ribose/aromatic 13C resonances of a given ribonucleotide.
    Uses isotropic 13C mixing.

    Standard features include maintaining the C13 carrier in the ribose/aromatic
    region throughout.
    Optional 2H decoupling when C13 magnetization is transverse and 
    during 1H shift evolution for 4 channel spectrometers.

    Based on hcchtocsy_3c_pfg_500.c written by Lewis Kay, Sept and Dec 92.  
    Revised and improved to a standard format by MRB, BKJ and GG for the 
    BioPack, January 1997. Increased and scaled spinlock field (GG).


    Efficient STUD+ decoupling is invoked with STUD='y' without need to 
    set any parameters.
    (STUD+ decoupling- Bendall & Skinner, JMR, A124, 474 (1997) and in press)
     
    STUD DECOUPLING.   SET STUD='y':
       Setting the flag STUD='y' overrides the decoupling parameters listed in
       dg2 and applies STUD+ decoupling instead.  In consequence is is easy
       to swap between the decoupling scheme you have been using to STUD+ for
       an easy comparison.  The STUD+ waveforms are calculated for your field
       strength at the time of RnaPack installation and RF power is 
       calculated within the pulse sequence.  The calculations are for the most 
       peaks being greater than 90% of ideal. If you wish to compare different 
       decoupling schemes, the power level used for STUD+ can be obtained from 
       dps - subtract 3dB from that level to compare to decoupling schemes at
       a continuous RF level such as GARP.  The value of 90% has
       been set to limit sample heating as much as possible.  If you wish to 
       change STUD parameters, for example to increase the quality of decoupling
       (and RF heating) change the 95% level for the centerband
       by changing the relevant number in the macro rna_makeSTUDpp and 
       rerun the macro (don't use 100% !!).  (At the time of writing STUD has
       been coded to use the coarse attenuator, because the fine attenuator
       is not presently included in the fail-safe calculation of decoupling 
       power which aborts an experiment if the power is too high - this may
       lower STUD efficiency a little).


        	  CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

    Set dm = 'nny', dmm = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for 13C decoupling.
    Set dm2 = 'nny', dmm2 = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for 15N decoupling.
    Not for STUD='y'
    	Set dm2 = 'nny', dmm = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for 13C decoupling.
	Set dm3 = 'nnn' for no 2H decoupling, or
		  'nyn'  and dmm3 = 'cwc' for 2H decoupling. 
  
    Must set phase = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI acquisition in
    t1 [1H]  and t2 [13C].
    
    The flag f1180/f2180 should be set to 'y' if t1 is to be started at
    halfdwell time. This will give -90, 180 phasing in f1/f2. If it is set to
    'n' the phasing should be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.  Thus,
    set f1180 = 'n' for (0,0) in 1H and f2180 = 'n' for (0,0) in 13C.





          	  DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF rna_hcch_tocsy


    1. Obtain a printout of the Philosopy behind the RnaPack development,
       and General Instructions using the macro: 
                                      "printon man('RnaPack') printoff".
       These Detailed Instructions for rna_hcch_tocsy may be printed using:
                                      "printon man('rna_hcch_tocsy') printoff".
             
    2. Apply the setup macro "rna_hcch_tocsy".  This loads the relevant parameter
       set and also sets ni=ni2=0 and phase=phase2=1 ready for a 1D spectral
       check.

    3. The parameter ncyc corresponds to the number of cycles of DIPSI-3 mixing.
       ribose='y':	mixing time = 20-30ms (35 ppm rf field).
       AH2H8='y':	mixing time = 100ms (30 ppm rf field).

       The DIPSI rf field should be sufficient to cover the ribose or
       C2-C4-C6-C8 aromatic region and adequate for the CC J's.
      
    4. Centre H1 frequency on H2O (4.7ppm), C13 frequency on 75ppm, and N15 
       frequency on the aromatic N region (200 ppm).
       ribose='y' sets dof to 80ppm.				Set sw=5ppm.
								Set sw1=5ppm.
								Set sw2=55ppm.
       AH2H8='y' sets dof to 145ppm.                            Set sw=10ppm.
                                                                Set sw1=4ppm.
                                                                Set sw2=30ppm.

    5. The 90 degree carbon pulse following the DIPSI mixing is phase cycled
       when nt=8 to eliminate z magnetization.  However this should be removed 
       anyway by the 90/gradient pair, so 4 transients should suffice if 
       sufficient S/N is available.

    6. The flag H2Opurge = 'y' is provided to bring H2O and other H1 z 
       magnetization to the xy plane for gradient suppression.

    7. taua (1.7 ms), taub (0.42 ms) and tauc (1 ms) are a starting point
       The values are listed in dg2 for possible readjustment by the user.

    8. If 2H decoupling is used, the 2H lock signal may become unstable because
       of 2H saturation.  Check that a 1D spectrum is stable/reproducible as 
       when 2H decoupling is not used.  You might also check this for d2 and d3
       equal to values achieved at say 75% of their maximum.  Remember to return
       d2=d3=0 before starting a 2D/3D experiment.
