 CTgChsqc_JCH    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the 
                     following experiment:

   13C-1H CT HSQC   with gradient coherence selection and JCH measurements
                (N.Tjandra and Ad Bax JMR 124 512-515 1997)
                
                  modJCH - flag to use JCH modulation
                  timeCT constant-time for 13C evolution,  1/JCC ca 13-14ms

                  timeJCH - "delta" for JCH evoution,  
                             total JCH evoution is 2*(timeCT-timeJCH)


		for a pseudo-3D spectrum:
			set modJCH='y'
			set ni large enough to resolve CA in the indirect 
                          dimension (or to fill full CT time)
			array timeJCH from 0.0 to 2.4ms
			set phase = 1,2 array='timeJCH,phase'

     ADJUST gzlv3/lgzlvl4 (CODING/DECODING GRADIENTS) FOR MAX INTENSITY  

        	  CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

    Set dm = 'nny', dmm = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for C13 decoupling.
    Set dm2 = 'nyn', dmm2 = 'cpc' (or 'cwc', or 'cgc') for N15 decoupling.

    Must set phase = 1,2  for States-TPPI acquisition in t1 
    
    The flag f1180 should be set to 'y' if t1 is to be started at halfdwell
    time. This will give 90, -180 phasing in f1 and fpmult=1. 

   FOR INOVA THERE STILL MIGHT BE A NEED FOR CORRECTING t1 FOR AP DELAYS
