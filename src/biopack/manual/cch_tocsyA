  cch_tocsyA               

   This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following
   experiment:

   3D CCH-TOCSY utilising gradients but not coherence gradients.

   Correlates the sidechain aliphatic 13C resonances of a given amino acid.
   Uses isotropic 13C mixing.

   Projection reconstruction version (uses "pra" as angle)
    (E.Kupce, Varian)

   Standard features include maintaining the 13C carrier in the CaCb region
   throughout using off-res SLP pulses; full power square pulses on 13C 
   initially when 13CO excitation is irrelevant; square pulses on the Ca and
   CaCb with first null at 13CO; one lobe sinc pulses on 13CO with first null
   at Ca; optional 2H decoupling when CaCb magnetization is transverse and 
   during 1H shift evolution for 4 channel spectrometers.

   Efficient STUD+ decoupling is invoked with STUD='y' without need to 
   set any parameters.
   (STUD+ decoupling- Bendall & Skinner, JMR, A124, 474 (1997) and in press)

   STUD DECOUPLING.   SET STUD='y':
   Setting the flag STUD='y' overrides the decoupling parameters listed in
   dg2 and applies STUD+ decoupling instead.  In consequence is is easy
   to swap between the decoupling scheme you have been using to STUD+ for
   an easy comparison.  The STUD+ waveforms are calculated for your field
   strength at the time of BioPack installation and RF power is 
   calculated within the pulse sequence.  The calculations are for the most 
   peaks being greater than 90% of ideal. If you wish to compare different 
   decoupling schemes, the power level used for STUD+ can be obtained from 
   dps - subtract 3dB from that level to compare to decoupling schemes at
   a continuous RF level such as GARP.  The value of 90% has
   been set to limit sample heating as much as possible.  If you wish to 
   change STUD parameters, for example to increase the quality of decoupling
   (and RF heating) change the 95% level for the centerband
   by changing the relevant number in the macro makeSTUDpp and 
   rerun the macro (don't use 100% !!).  (At the time of writing STUD has
   been coded to use the coarse attenuator, because the fine attenuator
   is not presently included in the fail-safe calculation of decoupling 
   power which aborts an experiment if the power is too high - this may
   lower STUD efficiency a little).

   AUTOCAL and CHECKOFS.
   The autocal and checkofs flags are generated automatically in Pbox_bio.h
   If these flags do not exist in the parameter set, they are automatically 
   set to 'y' - yes. In order to change their default values, create the  
   flag(s) in your parameter set and change them as required. 
   The available options for the checkofs flag are: 'y' (yes) and 'n' (no). 
   The offset (tof, dof, dof2 and dof3) checks can be switched off  
   individually by setting the corresponding argument to zero (0.0).
   For the autocal flag the available options are: 'y' (yes - by default), 
   'q' (quiet mode - suppress Pbox output), 'r' (read from file, no new  
   shapes are created), 's' (semi-automatic mode - allows access to user  
   defined parameters) and 'n' (no - use full manual setup, equivalent to 
   the original code).


   CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

   Set dm2 = 'nny', dmm = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for 13C decoupling.
   Set dm3 = 'nnn' for no 2H decoupling, or
   'nyn'  and dmm3 = 'cwc' for 2H decoupling. 

   Must set phase = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI acquisition in
   t1 [1H]  and t2 [13C].

   The flag f1180/f2180 should be set to 'y' if t1 is to be started at
   halfdwell time. This will give 90, -180 phasing in f1/f2. If it is set to
   'n' the phasing should be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.  Thus,
   set f1180 = 'n' for (0,0) in 1H and f2180 = 'n' for (0,0) in 13C.



   DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF cch_tocsy


   1. Obtain a printout of the Philosopy behind the BioPack development,
   and General Instructions using the macro: 
   "printon man('BioPack') printoff".
   These Detailed Instructions for cch_tocsy may be printed using:
   "printon man('cch_tocsy') printoff".

   2. Apply the setup macro "cch_tocsy".  This loads the relevant parameter
   set and also sets ni=ni2=0 and phase=phase2=1 ready for a 1D spectral
   check.

   3. The parameter ncyc corresponds to the number of cycles of DIPSI-3 mixing.
   Use ncyc = 2 or 3 usually.  This corresponds to a total mixing time of
   (2 or 3)*7.8*600/sfrq msec.  The DIPSI rf field should be
   sufficient to cover the aliphatic region (50 ppm = 10 kHz on 800
   MHz spectrometers) and adequate for the CC J's.  However, change the
   spinlock value if a different 
   rf strength is required. The rf field is typically 9 kHz for 600 MHz and
   scaled up or down for other magnets.

   4. Centre H1 frequency on H2O (4.7ppm), C13 frequency on 35ppm, and N15 
   frequency on the amide region (120 ppm).  The C13 frequency remains at 
   35ppm, ie in the center of the aliphatic region throughout the sequence.

   5. The 90 degree carbon pulse following the DIPSI mixing is phase cycled
   when nt=8 to eliminate z magnetization.  However this should be removed 
   anyway by the 90/gradient pair, so 4 transients should suffice if 
   sufficient S/N is available.

   6. The flag H2Opurge = 'y' is provided to bring H2O and other H1 z 
   magnetization to the xy plane for gradient suppression.

   7. taua (1.7 ms), taub (0.42 ms) and tauc (1 ms) were determined for
   alphalytic protease and are listed in dg2 for possible readjustment by
   the user.

   8. If 2H decoupling is used, the 2H lock signal may become unstable because
   of 2H saturation.  Check that a 1D spectrum is stable/reproducible as 
   when 2H decoupling is not used.  You might also check this for d2 and d3
   equal to values achieved at say 75% of their maximum.  Remember to return
   d2=d3=0 before starting a 2D/3D experiment.
