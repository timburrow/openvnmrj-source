NN4Doesy_trosyA
       This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiment:
	4D 15N 15N edited noesy, with TROSY detection in F3,F4. 
         (modified from N_N_noesy_4d_pfg_trosy_lek.c)


      Set N_flg to y to eliminate evolution during t2
      (during the running of some test 2D sets before running the 4D)

      Because of the large numbers of shaped water pulses do not use
       rectangular ones.(use seduce or sinc).

      Modified by L.E.Kay on Nov. 8 to allow for diagonal peak suppression.
       Set diag_supp to y.

      Modified by L.E.Kay on Nov. 9 to use gd. coherence selection
      (Unlike the 4D N_N experiment which uses adiabatic pulses generated
       as .DEC files, the present version uses adiabatic pulses)

       The autocal and checkofs flags are generated automatically in Pbox_bio.h
       If these flags do not exist in the parameter set, they are automatically 
       set to 'y' - yes. In order to change their default values, create the  
       flag(s) in your parameter set and change them as required. 
       The available options for the checkofs flag are: 'y' (yes) and 'n' (no). 
       The offset (tof, dof, dof2 and dof3) checks can be switched off  
       individually by setting the corresponding argument to zero (0.0).
       For the autocal flag the available options are: 'y' (yes - by default), 
       'q' (quiet mode - suppress Pbox output), 'r' (read from file, no new  
       shapes are created), 's' (semi-automatic mode - allows access to user  
       defined parameters) and 'n' (no - use full manual setup, equivalent to 
       the original code).
