  ghn_coca_cb

    3D HN(COCA)CB gradient sensitivity enhanced version.
    Designed for triply labeled proteins with H2(>80%), C13 and 15N.

    Correlates Cb(i-1) with N(i) and  NH(i).  Uses
    constant time evolution for the 15N shifts and 13Cb shifts (optional).
    TROSY option for   N15/H1 evolution/detection.

                 CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

        Set dm = 'nnn', dmm = 'ccc'
        Set dm2 = 'nny', dmm2 = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for 15N decoupling.
        Set dm3 = 'nnn' for no 2H decoupling, or
                  'nyn'  and dmm3 = 'cwc' for 2H decoupling.


    Set CT_c='y' only if you have highly (>95%) deuterated protein
    Deuterium decoupling, dm3='nyn', is not default, but strongly recommended.

    Must set = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI acquisition in
    t1 [13C]  and t2 [15N].

    The flag f1180/f2180 should be set to 'y' if t1/t2 is to be started at
    halfdwell time. This will give 90, -180 phasing in f1/f2. If it is set to
    'n' the phasing should be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.  Thus,
    set f1180='n' for (0,0) in 13C and f2180='n' for (0,0) in 15N.  f1180='y' is
    ignored if ni=0, and f2180='y' is ignored if ni2=0.


                   DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF ghn_coca_cb


    1. Obtain a printout of the Philosopy behind the BioPack development,
       and General Instructions using the macro:
                                      "printon man('BioPack') printoff".
       These Detailed Instructions for ghn_coca_cb may be printed using:
                                      "printon man('ghn_coca_cb') printoff".

    2. Apply the setup macro "ghn_coca_cb".  This loads the relevant parameter set
       and also sets ni=ni2=0 and phase=phase2=1 ready for a 1D spectral check.
       

    3.  The delay tauCC is adjustable, 6.6ms seems to be ok, maybe
	shortened for bigger proteins.

    4.  set  highSN='y' for samples with high signal-to-noise ratios; this 
	inserts a gradient filter to remove possible artifacts for a price of 
	approx 1.5ms delay in CB t1 evolution.
        Set highSN='n' if you want to maximize signal (large proteins, low S/N)
       
    5. Centre H1 frequency on H2O (4.7ppm), C13 frequency (dof) on 46ppm, 
         C13 frequency dofCO on 174 ppm
	 and N15 frequency on the amide region (120 ppm). 

    6. H2O preservation is achieved according to Kay et al, except that a sinc
       one-lobe selective pulse is used to put H2O back along z.  This is much
       more selective than a hard, Seduce1, or gaussian pulse.

    7. TROSY:
       Set TROSY='y' and dm2='nnn' for a TROSY spectrum of the bottom right
       peak of the 2D coupled NH quartet (high-field H1, low-field N15).  The
       TROSY spectrum gives 50% S/N compared to the decoupled spectrum for a
       small peptide.  To select any of the other three peaks of the 2D coupled
       quartet, in a clockwise direction from bottom right, change t4/t10
       from x/y to x/-y to -x/-y to -x/y.  NOTE, the phases of the SE train
       are almost the same as those determined for the gNhsqc sequence.  The
       major difference is that kappa is eliminated compared to normal
       ghn_coca_cb so the N15 magnetization has not evolved with respect to the
       attached H's.  I.e. the N15 state would be Ix rather than IySz if there
       was no coherence gradient - this imparts a 90 degree shift so t8 is
       changed to y (from x in the normal spectrum).  Also gzlvl1 is after the
       180 N15 pulse rather than before as in gNhsqc, so the sign of icosel
       and the t4/t10 phase2 increments are also swapped compared to gNhsqc.
       For ghn_c... type sequences, H1 decoupling during the first timeTN is
       replaced by a pi pulse at kappa/2 to reduce S/N loss for large molecules
       during the first TN period.  For these sequences H2O flipback is
       achieved with two sinc one-lobe pulses, an additional one just before
       the SE train, similar to gNhsqc.
