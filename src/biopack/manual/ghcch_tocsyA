  ghcch_tocsyA               

    3D HCCH tocsy utilising gradients and double sensitivity enhancement.
    Also known as DE-H(C)CH-TOCSY.

    Uses optional magic-angle gradients.

    Correlates the sidechain aliphatic 13C resonances of a given amino acid.
    Uses isotropic 13C mixing.

    Standard features include maintaining the 13C carrier in the CaCb region
    throughout using off-res SLP one-lobe sinc pulses on 13CO with first null
    at Ca.  Maximum sensitivity is obtained using full power square pulses on 
    the CaCb region throughout.  DIPSI-3 rather than DIPSI-2 (suggested in the
    JMR article) is used as standard as in the other BioPack sequences;
    optional 2H decoupling when CaCb magnetization is transverse and during 1H
    shift evolution for 4 channel spectrometers.

    Efficient STUD+ decoupling is invoked with STUD='y' without need to 
    set any parameters.
    (STUD+ decoupling- Bendall & Skinner, JMR, A124, 474 (1997) and in press)
     
    STUD DECOUPLING.   SET STUD='y':
       Setting the flag STUD='y' overrides the decoupling parameters listed in
       dg2 and applies STUD+ decoupling instead.  In consequence is is easy
       to swap between the decoupling scheme you have been using to STUD+ for
       an easy comparison.  The STUD+ waveforms are calculated for your field
       strength at the time of BioPack installation and RF power is 
       calculated within the pulse sequence.  The calculations are for the most 
       peaks being greater than 90% of ideal. If you wish to compare different 
       decoupling schemes, the power level used for STUD+ can be obtained from 
       dps - subtract 3dB from that level to compare to decoupling schemes at
       a continuous RF level such as GARP.  The value of 90% has
       been set to limit sample heating as much as possible.  If you wish to 
       change STUD parameters, for example to increase the quality of decoupling
       (and RF heating) change the 95% level for the centerband
       by changing the relevant number in the macro makeSTUDpp and 
       rerun the macro (don't use 100% !!).  (At the time of writing STUD has
       been coded to use the coarse attenuator, because the fine attenuator
       is not presently included in the fail-safe calculation of decoupling 
       power which aborts an experiment if the power is too high - this may
       lower STUD efficiency a little).


        	  CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

    	Set dm = 'nny', dmm = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for 13C decoupling.
	Set dm3 = 'nnn' for no 2H decoupling, or
		  'nyn'  and dmm3 = 'w' for 2H decoupling. 
  
    Must set phase = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI acquisition in
    t1 [1H]  and t2 [13C].

    2D experiment in t1: wft2d(1,0,-1,0,0,1,0,1) (sensitivity-enhanced)
    2D experiment in t2: wft2d('ni2',1,0,-1,0,0,1,0,1) (sensitivity-enhanced)
    ( or with 5.2F or above just use wft2da or wft2da('ni2') after setting
      f1coef='1 0 -1 0 0 1 0 1'
      f2coef='1 0 -1 0 0 1 0 1'
     for 3D just use ft3d )
    
    The flag f1180/f2180 should be set to 'y' if t1/t2 is to be started at
    halfdwell time. This will give -90, 180 phasing in f1/f2. If it is set to
    'n' the phasing should be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.  Thus,
    set f1180='n' for (0,0) in 13C and f2180='n' for (0,0) in 15N.  f1180='y' is
    ignored if ni=0, and f2180='y' is ignored if ni2=0.




          	  DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF ghcch_tocsy

    1. Obtain a printout of the Philosopy behind the BioPack development,
       and General Instructions using the macro: 
                                      "printon man('BioPack') printoff".
       These Detailed Instructions for ghcch_tocsy may be printed using:
                                      "printon man('ghcch_tocsy') printoff".
             
    2. Apply the setup macro "ghcch_tocsy".  This loads the relevant parameter
       set and also sets ni=ni2=0 and phase=phase2=1 ready for a 1D spectral
       check.

    3. The parameter ncyc corresponds to the number of cycles of DIPSI-3 mixing.
       Use ncyc = 2 or 3 usually.  This corresponds to a total mixing time of
       (2 or 3)*6.07*600/sfrq ms for a DIPSI rf field of 9 kHz for a 600Mhz 
       spectrometer, is sufficient to cover 14.4 kHz of bandwidth (96ppm at 600
       MHz, more than adequate for the CC J's. Change the value of spinlock to
       increase or reduce the bandwidth. 
      
    4. Centre H1 frequency on H2O (4.7ppm), C13 frequency on 35ppm, and N15 
       frequency on the amide region (120 ppm).  The C13 frequency remains at 
       35ppm, ie at CaCb throughout the sequence.

    5. del (3.4 ms), del1 (1.9 ms), and del2 (1.6 ms), were determined for 
       alphalytic protease and are listed in dg2 for possible readjustment by
       the user. The above reference (Fig.1) gives theoretical values of 0.5/J,
       0.31/J and 0.23/J for del, del1 and del2 and elsewhere in the reference,
       3.6, 2.2 and 1.9 ms can be inferred. 

    6. If 2H decoupling is used, the 2H lock signal may become unstable because
       of 2H saturation.  Check that a 1D spectrum is stable/reproducible as 
       when 2H decoupling is not used.  You might also check this for d2 and d3
       equal to values achieved at say 75% of their maximum.  Remember to return
       d2=d3=0 before starting a 2D/3D experiment.

    7. A 2D CH spectrum will be an ordinary 13C hsqc since evolution in t2 occurs
       after the c13 spinlock. Therefore, CH 2D spectra using hcch_tocsy.c cannot
       be compared with CH 2D spectra using ghcch_tocsy.c . However, 3D spectra
       will show all crosspeaks in both experiments. The magic-angle option does
       permit somewhat better water suppression using ghcch_tocsy.
