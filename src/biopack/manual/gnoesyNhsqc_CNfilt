	Uses isotope-filtering element invented by Stuart et al.,
	J.Am.Chem.Soc. 121, 5346-5347 (1999)

	Set:
	d2	= 0
	tauxh	= 1/(4Jxh)

        satmode = 'y' for presat
	satdly	= length of presaturation period
	satpwr	= power level for presat

	gstab   = gradient recovery delay
	gt1	= gradient pulse to remove initial X nucleus magnetization
	gt2	= cleaning gradient
	gt3	= gradient pulse during initial IzSz period
	gt4	= gradient pulse during second IzSz period (array gzlvl4 for maximum s/n)
	gt5	= cleaning gradient
	gzlvl1 ... gzlvl5

        For gt2=gt3=gt4=gt5, gzlvl2-gzlvl3+gzlvl4+gzlvl5 must =0.

        Half-dwell time delay standard in t1 and t2. Use lp1=-180 
        rp1=90; lp2=-180 rp2=90 for proper phasing.

        To permit adjustment of the filter gradients' strength, the
        parameter gscale can be used. It will multiply gzlvl2,gzlvl3,
        gzlvl4 and gzlvl5 by the same factor. The ratio must be 
        maintained, however.
