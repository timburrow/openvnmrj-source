Parameters:
        sspul      - flag for optional GRD-90-GRD steady state block
        gzlvl0     - gradient power level for sspul
        gt0        - gradient duration for sspul
        mix        - duration of the DIPSI-2 mixing along Z
                     (the pulse width and the corresponding power level
                      are internally calculated from strength and compH)
        strength   - amplitufe of the B1 mixing field (in Hz)
        compH      - 1H amplifier compression factor
        gt2        - homospoil gradient duration after mixing
        flipback   - flag for an optional selective 90 flipback pulse
                          on the solvent to keep it along z all time
        flipshape  - shape of the selective pulse for flipback='y'
        flippw     - pulse width of the selective pulse for flipback='y'
        flippwr    - power level of the selective pulse for flipback='y'
        flippwrf   - fine power for flipshape by default it is 2048
                        may need optimization with fixed flippw and flippwr
        phincr1    - small angle phase shift between the hard and the
                            selective pulse for flipback='y' (1 deg. steps)
                            to be optimized for best result
        wrefshape  - shape file of the 180 deg. selective refocussing pulse
                        on the solvent (may be convoluted for
                                multiple solvents)
        wrefpw     - pulse width for wrefshape (as given by Pbox)
        wrefpwr    - power level for wrefshape (as given by Pbox)
        wrefpwrf   - fine power for wrefshape
                      by default it is 2048 needs optimization for
                      multiple solvent with fixed wrefpw suppression only
        gt3        - gradient duration for the solvent suppression echo
        gzlvl3     - gradient power for the solvent suppression echo
        gstab   - gradient stabilization delay
        zqflg   - optional flag for ZQ suppression
                  The shaped pulses and gradient powers are
                  calculatred on-the-fly.
        alt_grd - alternate gradient sign(s) in ZQ-filter on even transients
        C13refoc   - flag for C13 decoupling in F1
        pwC        - 90 deg. C13 pulse for F1-C13 decoupling
        pwClvl     - C13 power level for pwC
        N15refoc   - flag for N15 decoupling in F1 (using 3rd channel)
        pwN        - 90 deg. N15 pulse for F1-N15 decoupling
        pwNlvl     - N15 power level for pwN
        CNrefoc    - flag for simultaneous C13 and N15 dec. in F1
                     (for safety reasons both power levels are automatically
                      droped by 3dB for the simultaneous pulses and
                      the corresponding pulse widths (pwC and pwN) are also
                      internaly corrected)
       F2 decoupling is set by the ususal decupling parameters
                     (adiabatic decouplings schemes are recommended)

Warning: The sequence requires minimum 2 low-band decoupler channels
         for C13 and N15 respectively
p. sandor, darmstadt jan. 2007.

 The parameters: gcal_local, coil_size and h1freq_local necessary
 for ZQ suppression are taken from the probe file by the setup macro or
 calculated automatically.
 The parameter swfactor controling the width of the frequency range to be
 refocused for the ZQ filter is set to 9.0 in the pulse sequence. For
 wide spectral windows the inversion range is limited to 60 kHZ to prevent
 dangerously high gradient levels to be set.
