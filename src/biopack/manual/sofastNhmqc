SOFAST N15 HMQC with options

   standard version (ipap_flg='n' dm2='nny')   

   IPAP version (ipap_flg='y', dm2='nnn'),                

   SE-IPAP version ( SE='y',dm2='nnn')

   ab_flg='a','b'  and  dm2='nnn'              
        (no 15N decoupling)                  
   interest : cryogenic probes, JNH couplings  

If ipap_flg='n' the experiment is States-Haberkorn and uses default
coefficients for wft2da (non-sensitivity enhanced processing).

With ipap_flg='y' and ab_flg='a','b' phase=1,2 array='ab_flg,phase'
you can acquire both antiphase and in-phase spectra at the same time. 

        wft2d(1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0,0)     for anti-phase signals
        wft2d(0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1)     for in-phase signals
        wft2d(1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0,-1)    for sum (one component)
        wft2d(1,0,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0,1)    for diff (other component)

The BioPack setup macro (sofastNhmqc) will use Pbox to create
the necessary shaped pulses and decoupling patterns. It will also
use the created shapefiles to obtain parameter values for the pulse
widths and power levels (and dmf value for decoupling).

HET-SOFAST options added to basic sofastNhmqc.c: (B.Brutscher, December 2006)

Shaped 1H pulses are calculated within the sequence if autocal='y' using
these variable (otherwise, the shapes/powers/widths are those generated by the
setup macro):

Typical settings:
  shbw=4: excitation band width
  shofs=8.2 center of excitation (set >9 to minimize H2O excitation)
   NOTE: values are in ppm of referenced chemical shift (tof at H2O)
  flipangle (120) to be used with d1 ~ 100 to 300 ms
            (140) for fast pulsing d1 ~ 1 ms

flags:
set hetsofast_flg='n' for standard N15 HMQC SOFAST experiment

set hetsofast_flg-'a' for selective inversion of aliphatic protons 
to measure "proton spin density

set hetsofast_flg='n' for H2O inversion to measure water accessibility

set c13refoc ='y'  for refocussing C13 180 in t1 (for 13C labelled proteins)
set ipap_flg = 'y' for IPAP (no 15N decoupling during acquisition)

Three experiments have to be recorded:
(a) reference experiment, hetsofast_flg='n'
(b) aliphatic-perturbed spectrum, hetsofast_flg='a'
(c) water-perturbed spectrum, hetsofast_flg='b'

The ratio of peak intensities in (b) over (a) gives insight into proton density 


Optimization of cancellation of water signal:
 A fine power (tpwrsf) is available for optimization of water suppression. If 
 tpwrsf<4095.0 it is active. To optimize tpwrsf,
 set nt=1 ssfilter='n' d1=3 ss=0 gain=2 array('tpwrsf',20,1800,20) go wft dssh dssl

please note :
  1) the automatic 15N decoupling works but it is done within the sequence(autocal='y' and dmm2='ccp')
     so the vnmr parameters don't show the changes (only "dps" shows the change in power, but not dmf2)
  2) For large 15N spectral width, one can lose one point in the indirect dimension 
     when the 1H and 15N pulses cross each other
