Simultaneous Detection of Amide and Methyl Correlations Using Time Shared NMR Experiment:
Application to Binding Epitope Mapping
J. Biomol NMR 39,97-105(October 2007)

    Set dm = 'nny', dmm = 'ccp', dm2 = 'nnn'

    Set phase = 1,2  for States-TPPI acquisition in t1.
    
   INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF gNCm_hsqc
         
    1. Run gNCm_hsqc macro.

    2. Set sw1 (C13) and sw2 (N15). sw1 >= sw2. kappa is calculated automatically.
    3. Processing of simultaneous absorptive phase of 13Cm-Hm and 15N-1H 
       is not possible. Use VnmrJ menus in Process...Process in t1 page.
    4. Refocusing gradients may need to be fine-tuned for optimal performance
       (array gzlvl2 for best NH signal. This may be closer to gzlvl1 than
       in gNhsqc).
