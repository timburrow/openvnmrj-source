 ghnca_Jnha_3D
 
This pulse sequence records an HNCA spectrum with 1JCa(i)-Ha(i)
splitting in F1-dimension and 2JN(i)-Ha(i) splitting in F2-dimension.

Set 13C carrier (dof) at 56ppm.

Set phase=1,2 and phase2=1,2 for 3D-spectrum.
Set dm='nnn', dm2='nnn'
Set f1180='y' and rp1=90 lp1=-180.
Set jnca=20

Semi-selective 13C' decoupling is applied during t1 and t2,

For a 1D check, set ni=1, ni2=1, phase=1, phase2=1 and use wft.

For a 2D experiment:

CH: set ni, phase=1,2 phase2=1 and f1coef='1 0 0 0 0 0 -1 0'.
        Use wft2da. This gives a 13Ca-1HN correlation spectrum.
        The cross peaks are split by 1J(CaHa) and 3JHNHa in
        13C and 1H dimensions, respectively.


NH: set ni2, phase=1, phase2=1,2 and f2coef='1 0 -1 0 0 1 0 1'.
        Use wft2da('ni2'). This gives a 15N-1HN correlation spectrum.


For a 3D experiment:

    Set ni, ni2, phase=1,2 phase2=1,2 f1coef='1 0 0 0 0 0 -1 0' and 
    f2coef='1 0 -1 0 0 0 1 0 1'.
    ft3d gives a three-dimensional 13Ca, 15N, 1HN correlation spectrum 
    displaying 1J(CaHa) doublets in 13Ca dimension. 
    The corresponding 2J(NHa), 3J(NHa) couplings for intraresidual and
    sequential cross peaks can be obtained from 15N dimension (13C-15N 
    plane). 
    3J(HNHa) and 4J(HNHa) couplings can be measured from 1H dimension
    for intraresidual and sequential correlations, respectively.
