   dqcosy - double quantum filtered cosy experiment


   ref: u. piantini, o.w. sorenson, and r.r. ernst,
        j. am. chem. soc. 104:6800-6801 (1982)
        m. rance et al., bbrc 117:479-485 (1983)


  Parameters:

         pw = 90 excitation pulse (at power level tpwr)
      phase =   0: P-type non-phase-sensitive experiment
              1,2: hypercomplex phase-sensitive experiment
                3: TPPI phase-sensitive experiment
      sspul = 'y': selects for HS-90-HS sequence at start of pulse sequence
              'n': normal DQCOSY experiment

         nt = min:  multiple of 16 (phase=0)
                    multiple of 8  (phase=1,2  phase=3)
              max:  multiple of 64 (phase=0)
                    multiple of 32 (phase=1,2  phase=3)

  NOTE:  If phase = 3, remember that sw1 must be set to twice the
         desired value.  The 4-january revision included the following
         sequence at the beginning of the pulse sequence:  homospoil -
         90 degree pulse - homospoil.  This should eliminate both the
         DQ-like artifacts in the 2D spectrum and the oscillatory nature
         of the steady-state.  This inclusion is selected if sspul='y'.
