 PR42_gChmqcnoesyNhsqcA.c

 This methyl-NH NOESY sequence is only suitable for 2H/13C/15N, ILV-methyl labeled samples.

 4D 13C-HMQC ------- NOESY ------- 15N-HSQC

 DESCRIPTION and INSTRUCTIONS:
 This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiment:
    (t1) -->  1H
    (t2) --> 13C
    (t3) --> 15N

 OFFSET POSITION:
    tof     =   ~4.75 ppm (1H on water).
    tofali  =   1H offset for methyl region 
    dof     =   13C offset for methyl region 
    dofcaco =  120 ppm (Center of Ca and CO).
    dof2    =  120 ppm (15N region).

 For CH3-NH experiment, set codec='n'
 CA/CO decoupling in t3 is achieved with a stC200 pulse
