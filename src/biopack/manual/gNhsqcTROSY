   15N gradient coherence selection TROSY

   SOME CARE WAS TAKEN FOR CORRECTING FOR INOVA-TYPE AP DELAYS. NOT TESTED.

   15N/1H multiplet component selection

       peak='LR' default setting, selects  [L]ower [R]ight, narrowest component.
                 other options: 'UR' - [U]pper [Right], 'LL', 'UL'
   
       TROSY:   Pervushin et al. PNAS, 94, 12366-12371 (1997),

   exp_mode='R' for a rough estimate of effective R2 relaxation
                of 15N N(a/b) magnetization during timeTN. 
                This option can be used for estimation of protein 
                rotational correlation times "TRACT"    

   TRACT:   set exp_mode='R',  array timeTN up to ~100-200ms

            record 1D/2D series with peak='LR' and peak='UR' 
       
            The difference in relaxation rates for 'LR' and 'UR' 
            is the cross-correlated relaxation rate which is, in turn,
            proportional to the rotational correlation time.

   NOTE:  array gzlvl6 (coherence-selection decoding gradient) to find max transfer efficiency
