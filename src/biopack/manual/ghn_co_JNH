 ghnco_JNH.c

    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiment:

    3D JHN_HNCO For the measurement of H-N dipolar coupling constant.
    ni(t1) --> 13CO
    ni2(t2)--> 15N

    OFFSET POSITION
       tof =   ~4.75 ppm (1H on water).
       dof =   174 ppm (13CO).
       dof2 =  120 ppm (15N region).

    Magic-angle option for coherence transfer gradients.

        	  CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

    	Set dm = 'nnn', dmm = 'ccc' 
    	Set dm2 = 'nny', dmm2 = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for 15N decoupling.

    The waltz16 field strength is enterable (waltzB1).
    Typical values would be ~6-8ppm, (3500-5000 Hz at 600 MHz).
  
    Must set phase = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI acquisition in
    t1 [C13]  and t2 [N15].
    
    The flag f1180/f2180 should be set to 'y' if t1/t2 is to be started at
    halfdwell time. This will give -90, 180 phasing in f1/f2. If it is set to
    'n' the phasing should be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.  Thus,
    set f1180='n' for (0,0) in C13 and f2180='n' for (0,0) in N15.  f1180='y' is
    ignored if ni=0, and f2180='y' is ignored if ni2=0.
