/*  rna_gChsqc.c

    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiment:

    HSQC with gradients for C13/H1 chemical shift correlation with optional
    N15 refocusing and numerous options for C13 decoupling, editing
    spectral regions, and measuring relaxation times.


    		      NOTE dof MUST BE SET AT 110ppm ALWAYS
                      NOTE dof2 MUST BE SET AT 200ppm ALWAYS

    
    THE ZZ OPTION [ZZ='y']:
    Suppresses H2O with gradients but does not use coherence gradients.  Must
    use ssfilter/ssntaps for good H2O suppression. It can be broadbanded to
    cover aromatic and ribose CHn groups by setting allC='y'. Alternatively,
    ribose='y' selects the dof for the ribose (H1' to H5'') region; and
    aromatic='y' selects the dof for the aromatic (H5/H6/H8/H2) region.

    THE ALTERNATIVE SE OPTION [SE='y']:
    Uses coherence gradients and the Sensitivity Enhancement
    train for better H2O suppression for CH resonances very close to H2O. 
    A theoretical root2 CH 2D enhancement should be gained.
    CH2 groups lose up to 50% S/N relative to the ZZ option.

    The sequence will function correctly with ribose='y'/aromatic='y'/allC='y'.

    VNMR processing when SE='y':for VNMR5.3 or later, use f1coef='1 0 -1 0 0 -1 0 -1'
    and wft2da. For earlier versions of VNMR use these coefficients as arguments
    for wft2da.

    THE CT OPTION: [CT='y']:
    This converts the t1 C13 shift evolution to Constant Time. Any combination 
    of ZZ='y'/SE='y' and ribose='y'/aromatic='y'/allC='y'can be used.
    The constant time delay, CTdelay(1/Jcc), can be set for optimum S/N for any type
    of groups, eg 28ms for ribose and 14ms for aromatics. For the allC option
    it is best to set the CTdelay to 1/Jcc(ribose) which equals 2/Jcc(aromatic).
    Note that in some options, CTdelays less than 8ms will generate an error
    message resulting from a negative delay.
  
    In all the above cases:
    * Selecting CH2only='y' will give a spectrum of only CH2 groups. 
    * A spectrum of only CH groups can be obtained as described in more detail 
    below.
    * N15 coupling in doubly-labelled samples is refocused by N15refoc='y'.
    * H2 coupling in triply-labelled samples is refocused by dm3='nyn'.
    * Efficient STUD+ decoupling is invoked with STUD='y' without need to 
    set any parameters.
    
    T1, T1rho, and T2 relaxation measurements of C13 nuclei can be made for any 
    combination of the above options, except for selecting CH2only='y'.

    1D checks of C13 and H1 pulse times can be made using calC and calH.

        	  CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

    Set dm = 'nny', dmm = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for 13C decoupling.
    Set dm2 = 'nny', dmm2 = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for 15N decoupling.
    Not for STUD='y' and allC='y'
    Set dm3 = 'nnn' for no 2H decoupling, or
	      'nyn'  and dmm3 = 'w' for 2H decoupling. 

    Must set phase = 1,2  for States-TPPI acquisition in t1 [C13].
    
    The flag f1180 should be set to 'y' if t1 is to be started at halfdwell
    time. This will give -90, 180 phasing in f1. If it is set to 'n' the 
    phasing should be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.  Thus,
    set f1180='n' for (0,0) in C13.  f1180='y' is ignored if ni=0.



          	  DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF rna_gChsqc

         
    1. Obtain a printout of the Philosopy behind the RnaPack development,
       and General Instructions using the macro: 
                                      "printon man('RnaPack') printoff".
       These Detailed Instructions for rna_gChsqc may be printed using:
                                      "printon man('rna_gChsqc') printoff".
             
    2. Apply the setup macro "rna_gChsqc".  This loads the relevant parameter set
       and also sets ni=0 and phase=1 ready for a 1D spectral check.

    3. Centre H1 frequency on H2O (4.7ppm), N15 frequency on the aromatic N
       region (200 ppm), and C13 frequency on 110ppm.

    4. CHOICE OF C13 REGION:
       ribose='y' gives a spectrum of ribose resonances centered on dof=80ppm.
       This is a common usage.                               Set sw1 to 50ppm.

       aromatic='y' gives a spectrum of aromatic groups.  dof is shifted
       automatically by the pulse sequence code to 130ppm.  Set sw1 to 70ppm.

       allC='y' gives a spectrum of ribose and aromatic resonances. dof is
       set by the code to 110ppm.                        Set sw1 to 110ppm.
       C13 shift during the 90 degree C13 pulses is not refocused for the
       first increment when ZZ='y' and allC='y' (use linear prediction).

    5. CALIBRATION OF pwC AND pw:
       calC and calH are multipliers of the first C13 and H1 90 degree pulses
       in the sequence.  They can be used to calibrate the pulses using a 1D
       spectrum.  Setting either calC or calH = 2.0 should give a S/N null (or 
       small dispersion signals) corresponding to the pulses being set at 180
       degrees.  Adjust pwC or pw, respectively, until this occurs.  An array
       of calC or calH = 1.8, 2.0, 2.2 is also convenient to judge the null at
       2.0.  calC and calH are automatically reset to 1 for 2D spectra if you   
       forget to do so.  Because of the width of the RNA ribose/aromatic C13 
       region, only the central portion of the H1 1D spectrum will be nulled
       when ribose='y' and calC=2.

    6. AMPLIFIER COMPRESSION AND PHASE SHIFT AT LOWER POWER:
       For optimum usage of the sequences in RnaPack, the parameter compC
       should be calibrated for the selected pwClvl.  Measure pwC as in point 5.
       Lower pwClvl by 6 dB (half RF amplitude) and measure pwC again calling
       it pwC'.  Then compC=pwC'/(2*pwC). If you do these calibrations using an
       RNA, it is best to utilise the aromatic region since dof needs to be
       close to the C13 resonances.
       If compC is less than 0.9 it is probably best to use a lower pwClvl so that 
       compC > 0.9 and amplifier compression does not need to be compensated so 
       heavily.
       Same procedure is used for compH using the rna_water sequence and compN
       using the rna_gNhsqc sequence. All values have to be written in the 
       rna_gChsqc parameter set and will be updated in the adequate sequences by
       the macro rna_pack3.

    7. N15 COUPLING:
       Splitting of resonances in the C13 dimension by N15 coupling in N15
       enriched samples is removed by setting N15refoc='y'.  No N15 RF is
       delivered in the pulse sequence if N15refoc='n'.  N15 parameters are
       listed in dg2.

    8. 1/4J DELAY TIMES:
       These are listed in dg/dg2 for possible change by the user. JCH is used
       to calculate the 1/4J time (lambda=0.94*1/4J) for H1 CH coupling evolution,
       tCH is the 1/4J time for C13 CH coupling evolution.
       Lambda is calculated a little lower (0.94) than the theoretical time to
       minimise relaxation, but tCH should be as close
       to the theoretical time as possible.  So for:
         ribose CH/CH2: 	  JCH=145Hz         tCH = 0.00172
         aromatic CH:       	  JCH=180Hz         tCH = 0.00139
	 allC:			  JCH=160Hz         tCH = 0.00156

    9. SPECTRAL EDITING FOR DIFFERENT CHn GROUPS.
       CH2only='y' provides spectra of just CH2 groups, by inserting two 1/4J
       periods of CH coupling evolution, where generally the parameter
			 tCH = 1/4J = 0.0018.
       CH groups are more accurately nulled using tCH = 0.00173. ZZ='y' is best
       for CH2's. CH2only flag cannot be used with relaxation time measurements.

       By setting tCH = 0.0009 with CH2only='y', CH2's are nulled.
       SE='y is best for CH spectra.

   10. T1 MEASUREMENTS OF CH GROUPS.  SET tCH = 0.00172 AND T1='y':
       An array of 1D or 2D spectra is obtained by arraying the relaxation time 
       parameter, relaxT, to a multiple of 5 milliseconds including zero.  
       relaxT corresponds exactly to the relaxation time of the C13 spins.  The 
       method uses 180 degree H1 pulses every 5ms during relaxT and transverse 
       magnetization is dephased by a gradient as according to Kay et al.
       SE='y' is best for CH's.  For aromatic CH's use tCH = 0.00139.

   11. T1 MEASUREMENTS OF CH2:
       Proceed as for point 10 but set tCH = 0.0009 for CH2 groups
       Unfortunately the H1 irradiation removes 
       spin order and about 50% S/N is lost for CH2.  Also 50% of
       CH intensity is retained so the overall result at relaxT=0 is a 
       normal 1D spectrum at about half intensity.  However accurate CH2 
       T1 times can be determined from resolved peaks in a 2D array.  
       ZZ='y' is best for CH2's.  

   12. T1rho MEASUREMENTS OF CHn GROUPS:
       Implemented by setting the flag T1rho='y' and arraying relaxT as above
       for T1.  relaxT corresponds exactly to the relaxation time of the C13 
       spins.  Spin lock power is set at 2.0 kHz for a 600 Mhz spectrometer,
       and scaled in proportion to other field strengths.  Increasing this RF
       (by changing the number 2000 in the DECLARE AND LOAD VARIABLES section
       of gChsqc.c) causes substantial sample or coil heating as indicated by 
       deterioration of the lock signal).  Care should be taken for relaxT
       times greater than 0.25 seconds, and times greater than 0.5 seconds are 
       automatically aborted.  A dummy period of spinlock RF is delivered at
       the beginning of each pulse sequence to ensure constant average sample 
       heating - the code determines this from the maximum relaxT you have set
       in your array of relaxT.  If T1rho measurements are to be made in 
       different experiments with different relaxTs, including arrays of 
       relaxT's, set the parameter maxrelaxT to the maximum relaxT you have
       set in all experiments - this will ensure constant average sample
       heating in all experiments.  maxrelaxT does not need to be set for a
       single array in a single exp.  The spectrum at relaxT=0 may be erroneous
       because of insufficient dephasing of unlocked spins.

   13. T2 MEASUREMENTS OF CH GROUPS:
       Implemented by setting the flag T2='y', but not recommended because 
       homonuclear C13 coupling invalidates the estimated relaxation time.
       Like T1rho, other parameters and flags are as for T1='y'.  Also, T2='y'
       delivers more sample heating than T1rho='y' for the same relaxation
       time.

   14. STUD DECOUPLING.   SET STUD='y':
       Setting the flag STUD='y' overrides the decoupling parameters listed in
       dg2 and applies STUD+ decoupling instead.  In consequence it is easy
       to swap between the decoupling scheme you have been using to STUD+ for
       an easy comparison.  The STUD+ waveforms are calculated for your field
       strength at the time of RnaPack installation and RF power is 
       calculated within the pulse sequence.  The calculations are for the most 
       efficient conditions to cover 140ppm when allC='y' with all decoupled 
       peaks being greater than 85% of ideal; 80ppm/90% for ribose='y' and 
       aromatic='y'.  If you wish to compare different
       decoupling schemes, the power level used for STUD+ can be obtained from 
       dps - subtract 3dB from that level to compare to decoupling schemes at
       a continuous RF level such as GARP.  The values of 85, 90, and 95% have
       been set to limit sample heating as much as possible.  If you wish to 
       change STUD parameters, for example to increase the quality of decoupling
       (and RF heating) for 30ppm decoupling say, change the 95% level for the 
       centerband, by changing the relevant number in the macro makeSTUDpp and 
       rerun the macro (don't use 100% !!).  (At the time of writing STUD has
       been coded to use the coarse attenuator, because the fine attenuator
       is not presently included in the fail-safe calculation of decoupling 
       power which aborts an experiment if the power is too high - this may
       lower STUD efficiency a little).
