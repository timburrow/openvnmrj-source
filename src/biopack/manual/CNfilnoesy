 CNfilnoesy

       This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiment:
       2D noesy of bound peptide with suppression of signals from 15N,13C
       labeled protein. The experiment is performed in water.

       To perform the D2O version set samplet='d' (vs samplet = 'w' for water)
                  and set dofaro = dof = 43 ppm. 

        Do not decouple during acquisition
