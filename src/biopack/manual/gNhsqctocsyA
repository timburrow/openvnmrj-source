  gNhsqctocsyA

    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiment:

    3D HSQC-TOCSY gradient sensitivity enhanced version for 15N, with
    H1-H1 TOCSY in the first dimension, and N15 shifts in the second.

    optional magic-angle coherence transfer gradients

    Standard features include optional 13C sech/tanh pulse on CO and Cab to 
    refocus 13C coupling during t1 and t2; one lobe sinc pulse to put H2O back 
    along z (the sinc one-lobe is significantly more selective than gaussian, 
    square, or seduce 90 pulses); preservation of H20 along z during t1 and the 
    relaxation delays; option of obtaining spectrum of only NH2 groups;

    Revised and improved to a standard format by MRB, BKJ and GG for the

    standard features within the pulse sequence code and associated macro.

    Modified from gnoesyChsqc.c in proteinpack


    Modified the amplitude of the flipback pulse(s) (pwHs) to permit user adjustment around
    theoretical value (tpwrs). If tpwrsf < 4095.0 the value of tpwrs is increased 6db and
    values of tpwrsf of 2048 or so should give equivalent amplitude. In cases of severe
    radiation damping( which happens during pwHs) the needed flip angle may be much less than
    90 degrees, so tpwrsf should be lowered to a value to minimize the observed H2O signal in 
    single-scan experiments (with ssfilter='n').(GG jan01)


        	  CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

    Set dm = 'nnn', dmm = 'ccc' for N15-labelled compounds
    Set dm = 'nny', dmm = 'ccg' or 'ccp' for C13,N15-labelled compounds
    Set dm2 = 'nny', dmm2 = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for N15 decoupling.

    Must set phase = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI acquisition in
    t1 [H1]  and t2 [N15].
   
    The flag f1180/f2180 should be set to 'y' if t1/t2 is to be started at
    halfdwell time. This will give -90, 180 phasing in f1/f2. If it is set to
    'n' the phasing should be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.  Thus,
    set f1180='n' for (0,0) in H1 and f2180='n' for (0,0) in N15.  f1180='y' is
    ignored if ni=0, and f2180='y' is ignored if ni2=0.



          	  DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF gNhsqctocsy

         
    1. Obtain a printout of the Philosopy behind the BioPack development,
       and General Instructions using the macro: 
                                      "printon man('BioPack') printoff".
       These Detailed Instructions for gNhsqctocsy are printed using:
                                      "printon man('gNhsqctocsy') printoff".
             
    2. Apply the setup macro "gNhsqctocsy". This loads the relevant parameter
       set and also sets ni=0 and phase=1 ready for a 1D spectral check.

    3. Centre H1 frequency on H2O (4.7ppm), C13 frequency on 35ppm, and N15 
       frequency on the amide region (120 ppm).

    4. Pulse and frequency calibrations are as for gNhsqc, or as generally
       used for BioPack.

    6. Splitting of resonances in the 1st or 2nd dimension by C13 coupling in 
       C13-enriched samples can be removed by setting C13refoc='y'.

    7. H2O preservation is achieved according to Kay et al, except that a sinc
       one-lobe selective pulse is used to put H2O back along z.  This is much
       more selective than a hard, Seduce1, or gaussian pulse.  H2O is cycled
       back to z as much as possible during t1 and t2.

    8. NH2 GROUPS:
       A spectrum of NH2 groups, with NH groups cancelled, can be obtained
       with flag NH2only='y'.  This utilises a 1/2J (J=94Hz) period of NH 
       J-coupling evolution added to t1 which cancels NH resonances and 
       inverts NH2 resonances (normal INEPT behaviour).  A 180 degree phase
       shift is added to a N15 90 pulse to provide positive NH2 signals.  The 
       NH2 resonances will be smaller (say 80%) than when NH2only='n'.

    9. Radiation Damping:
       At fields 600MHz and higher with high-Q probes, radiation damping is a
       factor to be considered. Its primary effect is in the flipback pulse
       calibration. Radiation damping causes a rotation back to the +Z axis
       even without a flipback pulse. Hence, the pwHs pulse often needs to 
       be reduced in its flip-angle. This can be accomplished by using the
       parameter tpwrsf. If this value is less than 4095.0 the value of tpwrs
       (calculated in the psg code) is increased by 6dB, thereby permitting
       the value of tpwrsf to be optimized to obtain minimum H2O in the 
       spectrum. The value of tpwrsf is typically lower than 2048 (half-maximum
       to compensate for the extra 6dB in tpwrs).
