       This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiment:

       2D hmqcj for the measurement of NH-HA coupling constants.
                 F1        15N
                 F2(acq)   NH
      
       Uses channels 1 and 3 of the standard 3 channel configuration
       1) 1H        - carrier (tof) @ 4.7ppm [H2O]
       2)
       3) 15N       - carrier (dof2) @ 120ppm [ centre of amide N]

       Set dm = 'nnn'  dmm = 'ccc'
           dm2 = 'nny' [15N decoupling during acquisition]

       Must set phase=1,2 for States-TPPI acquisition in t1 [15N]

       Flags
            fsat      'y' for presaturation of H2O
            fscuba    'y' to apply scuba pulse after presaturation of H2O
            mess_flg  'y' for 1H (H2O) purging before the relaxation delay
            f1180     'y' for 180deg linear phase correction in F1
            shp_flg   'y' for selective excitation and dephasing H2O mag.

       standard settings:
               fsat='n', fscuba='n', mes_flg='n', f1180='y', shp_flg='y'
