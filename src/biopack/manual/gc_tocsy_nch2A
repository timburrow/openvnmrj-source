  gc_tocsy_nch2A 

    This pulse sequence will allow one to correlate the side chain
    carbon resonances with the NZ amino group of lysines, and with the
    NE of arginines.

                F1      N
		F2	C
                F3(acq) H

    This sequence uses the standard three channel configuration
         1)  1H             - carrier (tof) @ H2O [4.77 ppm]
         2) 13C             - carrier (dof) @ aliphatic C [42 ppm]
         3) 15N             - carrier (dof2) @ center of NZ [33 ppm] for Lys only
                            or between Lys NZ and and Arg NE [59 ppm] for Lys and Arg
    
    Set dm = 'nnny', dmm = 'cccp' 
    Set dm2 = 'nnnn'

    Must set phase = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for States-TPPI acquisition in t1 and t2
    
    
    Flags
        fsat            'y' for presaturation of H2O
        fscuba          'y' for apply scuba pulse after presaturation of H2O
        f1180           'y' for 180 deg linear phase correction in F1 (15N)
        f2180           'y' for 180 deg linear phase correction in F2 (13CA)
			'n' for phases (0,0) which also gives perfect baseline
        ch_plane            to avoid 15N evolution when recording 2D CH plane

	Standard Settings
        fsat='n',fscuba='n',f1180='y',f2180='n'

        Improvements by fm, 03 May 2004
                added ch_plane flag for zero 15N evolution time when
                  recording HC plane
                added waltz 1H decoupling during 15N evolution

                set taub=1/4J (1.8 ms) to obtain
                100% transfer efficiency for CH2 (Hz -> Cx + 4CxHzHz)
