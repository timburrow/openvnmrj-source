    This pulse sequence will allow one to perform the following experiment:

    Base-correlation from Adenine-amino (N6) to H2/8 with options for the
    initial H->N transfer.

                  CHOICE OF DECOUPLING AND 2D MODES

    Set dm = 'nny', dmm = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for 13C decoupling.
    Set dm2 = 'nny', dmm2 = 'ccg' (or 'ccw', or 'ccp') for 15N decoupling.

    Must set phase = 1,2  for States-TPPI acquisition in t1 [H1].

    The flag f1180 should be set to 'y' if t1 is to be started at halfdwell
    time. This will give -90, 180 phasing in f1. If it is set to 'n' the
    phasing should be 0,0 and will still give a perfect baseline.  Thus,
    set f1180='n' for (0,0) in H1.  f1180='y' is ignored if ni=0.



                  DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF rna_Ahnctocsych


    1. Obtain a printout of the Philosopy behind the RnaPack development,
       and General Instructions using the macro:
                                      "printon man('RnaPack') printoff".
       These Detailed Instructions for rna_gChsqc may be printed using:
                                      "printon man('rna_Ahnctocsych') printoff".

    2. Apply the setup macro "rna_Ahnctocsych". This loads the relevant
       parameter set and also sets ni=0 and phase=1 ready for a 1D spectral check.

    3. Center H1 frequency on H2O (4.7ppm), N15 frequency on the aromatic N
       region (200 ppm), and C13 frequency on 110ppm.

    4. CHOICE of transfer:

       CP='y' uses CP for amino H1 -> N15 transfer.
       ncyc_hn should be set to ~7.5ms (1 or 2 at 500MHz) according to J(H-N) = 95Hz.

       CPMG='y' uses CPMG for amino H1 -> N15 transfer.
       ncyc should be set to 16 or 24.

       ncyc_nc should be set to ~45ms (3 at 500MHz) according to J(N6-C6) = 20Hz.
       ncyc_cc should be set to ~40ms (11 at 500MHz) according to J(C-C) = 12Hz.


       CP is generally the best.                     Set sw1 to 4ppm.
       A S/N of 3 is generally sufficient for this 2D experiment. Check
       by typing: ft dc getsn.

       If the adenine amino protons are broadened due to exchange, the initial
       magnetization transfer into the purine system is too low to yield the
       desired correlation. Check in N15 HSQCs. In that case use the rna_hcch_tocsy
       sequence to correlate adenine H2 to H8 (AH2H8='y').

    5. GRADIENTS:
       G3 and G4 should be optimized for sufficient water suppression.
       Typical values are G3=12G/cm and G4:-28G/cm.

       G5 and G0 should be 2-3G/cm.

       Gr suppresses radiation damping during t1 and should be 0.5 G/cm.

       In general, gradient-levels should be as low as possible.
