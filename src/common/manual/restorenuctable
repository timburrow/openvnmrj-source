 restorenuctable - Calculate & Store Accurate Nuctable for Current System  (M)
*******************************************************************************

 Syntax:      restorenuctable

 Description: The current "setref" conmtribution is based on a single, generic
	      nucleus table, "/vnmr/nuctables/nuctable", based on a standard
              proton frequency of 1000.0 MHz. As nuctables are scaled to some
	      standard frequency (which only in exceptional cases is identical
              to the actual proton frequency on your system) anyway, most
	      parts of VnmrJ / VNMR will also work properly with a table that
              is scaled to 1000.0 MHz. All standard nucleus tables in the
              directory "/vnmr/nuctables" are now symbolic links pointing to
	      that one, generic table.
              However, unfortunately, there are some known bugs (e.g., with
              "qtune") which cause certain commands in current software to
	      fail. Problems may also arise with custom macros and third party
	      software that may not be aware of the new, generic nucleus table
	      concept. As a workaround, "restorenuctable" can be used to
	      replace specifically those links that are used on your system
	      with proper, accurately calculated nucleus tables. With this,
	      those affected commands and utilities that do NOT scale nuctable
	      entries to the actual proton frequency (as they should) will
	      actually work BETTER than with the previous standard tables.
	      On VXR-S and UNITY systems, "restorenuctable" is NOT applicable.
