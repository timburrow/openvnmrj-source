Proshim uses a sophisticated curve-fitting technique to
optimize shim values.  By default proshim will make
adjustments using the method defined in  the parameter "method".
Shimming methods for proshim reside in the directory called 
"proshimmethods" located inside of this applications directory.

If the parameter method='z1z2', which is the old default value for 
lock simplex shimming, the proshim family of macros will replace this
with a method called "touchup".  

There is a menu and and entry box located in the group with the
Proshim Now button. The menu lists several provided methods that are
described in more detail below. If the user creates their own method
by adding a file inside a local ~/vnmrsys/proshimmethods directory
the menu source that is hard-coded in the proshimmethods directory
inside of this proshim applications directory can be edited in a 
simple fashion or the name of the new shim method can just be typed
into the entry box.

The format for proshimmethods files is very simple: One line each 
containing the name of the DAC that is to be adjusted. Proshim simply
goes through the list from top to bottom. Blank lines or invalid DAC
names are simply skipped. Inside of proshimmethods the word "spin"
is treated as a special case and when encounted the spinner is set
as defined in the line.  For example: spin=0 or spin=20.

An example method (xyz_extended) is shown below:

spin=0
z1
z2
x1
y1
xz
x1
yz
y1
xz2
xz
x1
yz2
yz
y1
xy
x2y2
x1
y1
z1

Clicking "Proshim Now" will run the desired shimming method in a 
background macro.  The current workspace will from time to time
be updated with messages showing which DAC is being adjusted. To
stop proshim that is running in background click the big red Abort
Proshim button and when the currently adjusting DAC is complete
proshim will halt.

If desired, proshim can be run in foreground but keep in mind that
since it is a running macro nothing else can be done until proshim 
is complete.  To do this type proshim on the commandline.  To abort
such a foreground macro click the Cancel Command button on the toolbar.

In all cases proshim will begin by adjusting lock parameters unless the 
ignore lock box is checked. This
is done to ensure that lockpower and lockphase are correct. The 
adjustment of lock parameters is done by a call to a macro called
set_lockpars.

There are additional factors involved in any shimming method based on lock
which are the delay between steps and the step sizes associated with
each shim.  These are defined in two files inside of the maclib called
shiminfo1 and shiminfo2. One of these has long delays and slightly
smaller steps and is chosen automatically for the case of solvent
equal to acetone, methanol, benzene, or cd2cl2.

The time required for proshim to execute is reasonably predictable. 
A time of right at 1 minute per DAC in the method should be expected
for solvents with the long delay time. This time reduces to about 25 
seconds per DAC for all other solvents. 

Also located on the Proshim panel is a is a group that is shown if an
autosampler of any type is present. This group contains the shim scheduler 
and it provides tools to easily define a sample location for the
lineshape sample and chose a shim maintenance method. Once this has
been done the bottom part of the Shim Scheduler allows the act of 
maintenence shimming to be scheduled. Note that this Shim_Scheduler
has it's very own help button.

The menu in the shim_scheduler offers three choices for lineshape
maintenance.  One is simply "Lineshape" which records a lineshape
result but no shimming is done other than normal Z-PFG shimming. The
other two methods are "FastLineshape" and "DeepFactoryShim". The 
FastLineshape method first acquires a lineshape spectrum with just
Z-PFG shimming followed by the proshim method xyz_extended. After 
proshim completes Z-PFG shimming is repeated followed by the final
lineshape spectrum.  The FastLineshape method should be a good choice
for weekly shim maintenance.

The protocol DeepFactoryShim first does lineshape with Z-PFG shim followed
by the  proshim method "allshims".  Z-PFG shim with a 2nd lineshape spectrum
is followed by the proshim method "xyz_basic" (default for proshim). The
method is completed by a final Z-PFG shim and lineshape spectrum.

Both of the provided lineshape shim maintenance methods provided in the
Service tab in the experiment selector that are listed in the shim_scheduler
method menu are built as userStudies with a combination of submissions
of Lineshape (with reshim option checked by customization) interspersed
with submissions of comman protocols of shimming macros.

The lineshape sample is perhaps the best choice to refined maintenance
shimming. A good 2nd choice might be the 19F signal to noise sample.
Absolutely avoid any doped d2o samples because they are not responsive
enough to yield good shimming results. 

In addition to the methods solely and specifically for Proshim contained in
the directory proshimmethods there is also a shimmethods directory provided
for use with traditional "simplex lock" autoshim. The provided methods
are constructed to work with the lineshape sample and are as follows:

simplex_xyz  - just x1, y1, and z1
simplex_xyz_basic  - xz, x1, yz, y1, z1
simplex_allnonspins - all radial shims that are accessible by lock autoshim
simplex_allzs  - z4, z3, z2, z1

Please remember that the parameter method is at this time shared between
both proshim and the traditional lock simplex autoshim.  Keeping the names
for methods in each world unique is not strictly required but is a good idea.
