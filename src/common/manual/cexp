cexp:		create a VNMR experiment

       Syntax:	cexp(<exp_dir,>exp_no):$stat,$message

  Description:	cexp creates a VNMR experiment which is used as a temporary
		work space and can hold a complete 1D, 2D, or 3D data set.
                The cexp macro will copy the "current" and "processed"
                parameter trees to the newly created experiment's
                curpar and procpar files. If the current experiment is exp0,
                or experiments 1-4 are being created as part of the "auto" command,
                the curpar and procpar files for the newly created experiment
                are copied from the procpar file in /vnmr/fidlib/fid1d.fid

                The cexp macro calls the CEXP command to create the experiment
                and copy the parameters.  The cexp macro then does the additional
                step of creating an appropriate jexp<N> macro in the user's maclib,
                where the  <N> is the exp_no and if exp_no is greater than 9.
                The macros jexp1 to jexp9 do not need to be created since they
                exist as standard VnmrJ macros.

                Both the CEXP command and cexp macro will return two optional
                values to the calling macro. The first ($stat) is set to 0 if
                the command / macro fails and it is set to 1 if the command /
                macro succeeds. The second return value is a text message that
                can be used.

    Arguments:	exp_no specifies the VNMR experiment number and must be
		between 1 and 9999.  exp_dir is an optional argument which
		specifies the path of the directory in which the particular
		experiment is to be created.  If exp_dir is not entered,
		the default directory is the VNMR user directory (userdir).

     Examples:	cexp(3)
		cexp('/data',2)
                cexp(32):$stat,$msg  // silently create exp32 and the jexp32 macro.
                                     // $stat reports success or failure. The $msg
                                     // message could be displayed.
                CEXP(33):$stat,$msg  // silently create exp33, but do not make
                                     // the jexp33 macro. $stat reports success
                                     // or failure. The $msg message could be
                                     // displayed.



delexp:		delete a VNMR experiment

       Syntax:	delexp(exp_no):$stat,$message

  Description:	delexp deletes a VNMR experiment.  Only experiments 2-9999
		can be deleted; experiment 1 cannot be deleted by
		delexp.

                The delexp macro calls the DELEXP command to delete the experiment
                The delexp macro then does the additional step of deleting an
                appropriate jexp<N> macro from the user's maclib, where the <N>
                is the exp_no and if exp_no is greater than 9.

                Both the DELEXP command and delexp macro will return two optional
                values to the calling macro. The first ($stat) is set to 0 if
                the command / macro fails and it is set to 1 if the command /
                macro succeeds. The second return value is text message that can
                be used.

                The DELEXP command has one special syntax, DELEXP('auto'). This
                schedules the current experiment to be deleted when the current
                background Vnmrbg finishes executing its command. This is only
                available from a background Vnmrbg. A typical usage would be for
                a foreground macro to assign a task to a background Vnmrbg in a
                separate experiment. For example,
                    nextexp:$e     // find number for a new experiment
                    CEXP($e):$stat // silently create the experiment
                    write('line3',`Vnmrbg -mback -n%d "DELEXP('auto') doMyMacro" &`,$e):$cmd
                    shell($cmd):$e  // run doMyMacro in background and delete experiment when done

    Arguments:	exp_no specifies the VNMR experiment number which is to be
		deleted.

     Examples:	delexp(2)
                delexp(75):$stat,$msg   // Silently delete exp75. If the deletion
                                        // is successful, also delete the jexp75 macro.
                DELEXP(77):$stat,$msg   // Silently delete exp77, but do not
                                        // delete the jexp77 macro.
