******************************************************************************
downsizefid<(factor,<datapath>)> - downsize or truncate fid by a factor 
downsizefid<(np,<datapath>)> - downsize or truncate fid to new np value
******************************************************************************
  
"factor" is a number greater than 0 and smaller than 1.0.
For example, downsizefid(0.5) will truncate the second half of a fid, as if it was 
acquired with half of the acquisition time (np=np/2, at=at/2). 
The default factor is 0.5.

Alternatively, one can supply the new value of np for the downsized FID. The new
value of np must be less than the current np for the FID data set.

An optional second argument specifies the filename of an FID file.
If there is no second argument, downsizefid will truncate the FID
in the current experiment.

If no second argument is given, the "current" and "processed" values
of "np" and "at" parameters will be updated.

If no second argument is given, this command will overwrite acqfil/fid
and acqfil/procpar in curexp.  If acqfil/fid is linked to a saved fid file,
the link will be replaced by a copy, so the original fid will not be overwritten.
 
If the fid file has multiple traces, all traces will be truncated.

This command can be repeated to further truncate the fid.
