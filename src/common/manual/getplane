getplane:  usage  -  getplane(<'datadir'>,<'planedir'>)

		     getplane(<'f1f3'>)

getplane is a macro which executes the program getplane in the VNMR
system `bin` directory ($vnmrsystem/bin).  'datadir' is an optional
argument which specifies the directory (without the /data subdirectory)
containing the input 3D spectral data.  'planedir' is an optional
argument which specifies the directory (without the /extr subdirectory)
in which the extracted planes are to be stored.  The first non-keyword
argument is taken to be 'datdir'; the second non-keyword argument is
taken to be 'planedir'.  If 'planedir' is not specified, 'datadir'
also specifies the output plane directory.  If 'datadir' is also not
specified, the input data directory and the output plane directory are
set to their default value, curexp/datadir3d.  The VNMR parameter `plane`
is always set equal to the output plane directory.

There are four optional keywords to the getplane macro.  'xall' indicates
that all three 2D plane types, F1F3, F2F3, and F1F2, are to be extracted.
'f1f3', 'f2f3', and 'f1f2' can be used to select any combination of
plane types to be extracted.  The getplane macro allows the user to
submit any of these keywords more than once.  The program getplane,
however, will display an error and abort if any one plane type is multi-
ply defined for extraction.

getplane checks to insure that there is sufficient file space on the
disk partition which is to accomodate the extracted planes.  If there
is insufficient space, an error is written by getplane to the VNMR
text window, and getplane subsequently aborts.  getplane does not delete
the output plane directory if it is run multiple times to individually
extract different plane types.

With the exception of 'datadir' and 'planedir', the order of the argu-
ments to the getplane macro is not important.
