         * bc      -       1D and 2D Baseline Correction *
         *************************************************

  BC performs baseline correction using a first to twentieth order
  polynomial fitting of pre-defined baseline regions.  BC uses every
  odd-numbered integral region (i.e., those integrals which disappear
  when intmod='partial') as baseline and attempts to set those points
  to zero.

  <> indicates that an argument is optional; the absence therefor
  indicates that an argument is mandatory.

  The optional argument 'ifnotddr' will skip the baseline correction if the
  data were acquired with a system with a direct-digital receiver. On these systems,
  the baseline is usually flat enough not to warrant additional corrections.
  If the data were not acquired with a system with a direct-digital receiver,
  the argument is ignored. The 'ifnotddr' argument must follow the 'f1' or 'f2'
  arguments if they are used. It must precede all other arguments.

  The bc command will return to the calling macro its status. It returns a 0
  if it failed. It returns a 1 if it succeeds. If the 'ifnotddr' argument is given
  and the bc operation is skipped, because the data were acquired with a direct-digital
  receiver system, it returns a 2. If the bc command fails and a return value is not
  requested, it will abort the calling macro.

  bc(<arg1>):

	arg1  -   (A) order of the polynomial used in the fitting
	          procedure; the default value is 1, which
		  obtains a spline fit; ranges from 1 to 20.

	          (B) 'unbc'; does not require that the order is
		  specified; BC reads in the order and the
		  coefficients used in the previous BC operation
		  and reverses the BC operation; only functional
		  for 1D baseline correction operations on either
		  1D spectra or individual 2D traces.

  bc('alt'<scale<,smooth>>) - An alternative automatic baseline correction
		  method developed by Carlos Cobas, etc... This method automatically 
		  finds signal-free regions using CWT (Continuous Wavelet Transform derivatives),
		  and models the baseline using uses Whittaker smoother algorithm.
		  This method should be used with proper selection of "scale"
		  and "smooth" parameters, in order to avoid "over correction"
		  (resulting in an unrealistically flat baseline).
		  
	scale  -  A scaling factor for calculating derivatives for CWT.
		  Increasing "scale" reduces noise, but broadens the signals.
		  "scale" may be calculated as a proportional function of 
		  the broadest signal. If scale is too small, the broad peaks
		  will be treated as baseline instead of peaks.
		  The value of "scale" may range from 1 to a few hundreds.
		  The default is 200 (a relatively large value to avoid losing broad peaks).

	smooth -  A smooth factor for baseline modeling. It increases smoothness 
		  at the expense of spectral fidelity (worse fitting of the data).
                  The value of "smooth" may range from 100 to tens of thousands.
		  The default value is 10000.
  bc('dis') -	calculate baseline of displayed 1D trace according to parameter bcmode,
		and display the baseline with spectrum (without correction).
  bc('all') - 	calculate and apply baseline correction for each trace of arrayed 1D spectra, 
		and save baseline(s) in curexp+'/datdir/bc.fdf'.
  bc('apply',name) - apply baseline correction according to baseline file *.fdf.
		The baseline file needs to be loaded prior to calling this command.
                The command to load baseline file is aipLoadSpec(fdfFile,name).
  bc('cancel') - undo baseline correction.


2D
--

  bc(arg1,<arg2>,<arg3>,<arg4>):

	arg1  -   'f1' or 'f2'; specifies the direction along
		  which the 2D BC is to take place.

	arg2  -   order of the polynomial used in the fitting
		  procedure; the default value is 1, which
		  obtains a spline fit; ranges from 1 to 20.

	arg3  -   trace number for the spectrum on which the
		  2D BC is to commence; must lie within the
		  appropriate range or an error will result.

	arg4  -   trace number for the spectrum on which the
		  2D BC is to terminate; must lie within the
		  appropriate range or an error will result.
