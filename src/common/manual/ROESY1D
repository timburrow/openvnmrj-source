ROESY1D - DPFGSEROE experiment

Selecting the ROESY1D experiment forces customization because the apptype is lstd1D.
Customization is mandatory because the peaks desired for selective inversion by the
pulse sequence must be chosen by the operator.  There is an option to acquire a mixR =
0 spectrum which would just be a spectrum with the selected peak only. This option is
not really needed for ROESY1D because the selected peak will be the large negative
peak in the result. For the TOCSY1D family the mixT = 0 spectrum can be very useful
because it is not always so obvious in the final spectrum which peak was selected.
