 f19p - Processing of 1D fluorine spectra (M)
*****************************************************************************

      Syntax: f19p

 Description: "f19p" is a macro for processing non-arrayed 1D fluorine spectra
              using a set of standard macros. f19p is called by the proc1d
	      macro, but can also be used "by hand".
	      Fully automatic processing (up to a point where a spectrum could
	      be plotted) is provided:
	      Fourier transformation (using pre-set weighting functions), auto-
	      matic phasing (aphx macro), select integral regions (hregions
	      macro), adjust integral size (integrate macro), vertical scale
	      adjustment (vsadjc macro), avoiding excessive noise (noislm
	      macro), threshold adjustment (if required, thadj macro), and
	      referencing to the TMS signal, if present (tmsref macro).
