plplanes:  usage  -  plplanes(startpl,stoppl,<pktype>,<numlvls>,<lvlspacing>)

plplanes creates the 2D contour plots for a subset of the 3D planes
specified by the VNMR parameter `plane`.  The arguments startpl and
stoppl are mandatory.  startpl specifies the number of the 3D plane
with which plotting is to begin; stoppl, the number of the 3D plane
with which plotting is to end.

startpl must be > 0.  If `plane` = 'f1f3', stoppl must be > 0 and < fn2/2;
if `plane` = 'f2f3', stoppl must be > 0 and < fn1/2; and if `plane` = 'f1f2',
stoppl must be > 0 and < fn/2.  If startpl is > stoppl, only the first plane,
whose number is startpl, will be plotted.

The optional arguments `pktype`, `numlvls`, and `lvlspacing` are for
the VNMR plotting command pcon.  `pktype` can take the values 'pos'
or 'neg'; `numlvls` specifies the number of contour levels to be
plotted; and `lvlspacing' specifies the scaling between successive
contour levels.



dsplanes:    usage  -  dsplanes(startpl,stoppl)

dsplanes produces a graphical 2D color or contour map for a subset of
3D planes.  The arguments startpl and stoppl are mandatory.  startpl
specifies the number of the 3D plane with which the display is to begin;
stoppl, the number of the 3D plane with which the display is to end.

startpl must be > 0.  If `plane` = 'f1f3', stoppl must be > 0 and < fn2/2;
if `plane` = 'f2f3', stoppl must be > 0 and < fn1/2; and if `plane` = 'f1f2',
stoppl must be > 0 and < fn/2.  If startpl is > stoppl, only the
first plane, whose number is startpl, will be displayed.  The dconi
program is used to display the planes.
