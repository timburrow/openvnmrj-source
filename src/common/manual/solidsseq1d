Solidspack Apptype Macros and fixtancpxpars


solids1d - An apptype macro for SolidsPack, used to load a standard 
           dataset. The solids1d apptype is used by the protocol macro 
           Settancpx to load the standard solids file Settancpx.par.

solidsseq1d - An apptype macro for SolidsPack, used to setup a 1D  
           pulsesequence. The solidsseq1d apptype is used by all 1D 
           protocols of SolidsPack. The solidsseq1d apptype loads 
           new parameters for a sequence, using the mechanism of 
           rtx('keep','noclear') and leaves current parameters
           in the workspace unchanged. Parameters labeled with bit 
           14 are loaded and the bit is retained in the workspace,
           preventing future overide of the values.

solidsseq1d - An apptype macro for SolidsPack, used to setup a 2D  
           pulsesequence. The solidsseq1d apptype is used by all 2D 
           protocols of SolidsPack. The solidsseq2d apptype loads 
           new parameters for a sequence, using the mechanism of 
           rtx('keep','noclear') and leaves current parameters
           in the workspace unchanged. Parameters labeled with bit 
           14 are loaded and the bit is retained in the workspace,
           preventing future overide of the values, uses par2d to 
           complete 2D setup. 

solidsseq1d - An apptype macro for SolidsPack, used to setup a 3D  
           pulsesequence. The solidsseq1d apptype is used by all 3D 
           protocols of SolidsPack. The solidsseq3d apptype loads 
           new parameters for a sequence, using the mechanism of 
           rtx('keep','noclear') and leaves current parameters
           in the workspace unchanged. Parameters labeled with bit 
           14 are loaded and the bit is retained in the workspace,
           preventing future overide of the values, uses par3d to 
           complete 3d setup. 

File entries are also found for solids1d, soldsseq1d, solidsseq2d
and solidsseq3d in the directory execpars. These entries are used 
by the protocols that invoke the respective apptype. 

fixtancpxpars - A macro called by soldsseq1d, solidsseq2d and
           solidsseq3d to update old datasets for the latest 
           version of solidspack. fixtancpxpars makes sure all 
           basic parameters exist and sets various types and 
           limits.
