******************************************************************************
writef1 - Write 2D interferograms as FIDs.
readf1 - read FIDs, as generated by writef1, into an experiment as interferograms.
******************************************************************************

2D interferograms can be written as an array of 1D FIDs. The file is written into the
current experiment with the name fidf1r. It is the same format as the fid file in .fid directories.
If the interferograms are hypercomplex, an additional file named fidf1i is written
into the current experiment. This file contains the imaginary F2 component of the interferograms.
For these new FIDs, fn1 is effectively np and fn/2 is effectively the number of FIDs (arraydim).

The writef1 command will abort if no interferogram data are available. Optionally, if a return
value is appended to the command, it will be set to 1 if the writef1 command succeeded and it
will be set to 0 if it fails. It will not abort the rest of the calling macro.

readf1 reads FIDs into an experiment as interferograms. Prior to using readf1, do a ft1d(a) to make
sure the internal status of the experiment is correct. The number of points and number of FIDs
in the fidf1r (and fidf1i if data are hypercomplex) must match the internal state of the
experiment after ft1d(a). That is, make sure fn and fn1 are set correctly prior to ft1d(a)
The fidf1r and fidf1i files must be in the current experiment.

The sequence
  ft1d writef1 readf1 ft2d
will give exactly the same result as
  ft1d  ft2d
or
  ft2d
