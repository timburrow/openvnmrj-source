edit('myfile') -        edit a file with user-selectable editor
macroedit('mycmd') -    edit a macro with user-selectable editor

   The "edit" command will edit a file, letting you select the editor
   program to be used.  Set the environmental parameter "vnmreditor"
   to be the desired editor program.  The default is "vi".

   You must provide a vnmr_<editor> script in the bin subdirectory of
   the VNMR system directory.  For example, if "emacs" is to be used,
   a script named "vnmr_emacs" would need to be present.  The major
   task for this script is determining if a GUI is in use and making
   required adjustments.  The scripts "vnmr_vi" and "vnmr_textedit"
   provide a mode for non-window and window-based editor interface
   respectively.

   The command "macroedit" will edit a Magical macro in your personal
   macro library.  System macros cannot be directly edited with this
   command; they must first be copied to your personal library first.
