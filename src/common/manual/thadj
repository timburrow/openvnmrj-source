 thadj - Adjust threshold for peak printout (M)
*******************************************************************************

      Syntax: thadj<(maximum_peaks<,noise_multiplier<,llarg1<,llarg2>>>)>

 Description: "thadj" adjusts the threshold "th", so that no more than maxpeak
	      peaks are found in a subsequent line listing command (see "ll"),
	      and so, that "th" is at least noise_multiplier times the r.m.s.
	      noise level. The default maximum for the number of peaks is wc/4,
	      i.e., the threshold is adjusted such that ppf will produce a
	      "reasonable" number of lines with any width of plot.

   Arguments: "maximum_peaks": The maximum number of peaks in the displayed
		spectral range.
	      "noise_multiplier": A noise multiplier that is used th calculate
		the minimum value for th from the size of the r.m.s. noise.
	      "llarg1": The first argument (noise multiplier, default=3) to the
		nll command used inside this macro 
	      "llarg2": The second argument ('pos','neg','all', default='all')
		to the nll command used inside this macro 
	      All arguments are optional.

    Examples: thadj
	      thadj(50)
	      thadj(200,4)
	      thadj(200,4,2)
	      thadj(200,4,2,'pos')
