cdump<'filename'> - print the current graphics screen
******************************************************************************

cdump takes the current display and sends it to the current printer.
If an optional filename is passed as an argument, the current display will
be saved in the print subdirectory of the user's vnmrsys directory.  This
directory will be created if is does not already exist.  If the filename
passed to the cdump macro is an absolute pathname, i.e., it starts with
a '/' character, that pathname will be used.
If the current display is saved as a file, the format of the file is specified
by the printformat parameter.  It can be set to the following values.

  ps   for PostScript formatted output.
  jpeg for Joint Photographic Experts Group JFIF formatted output.
  png  for Portable Network Graphics formatted output.
