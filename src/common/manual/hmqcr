  hmqcr - Heteronuclear Multiple-Quantum Coherence in "Reverse" Configuration
*******************************************************************************
j		X-H spin coupling constant
null		nulling time for protons not attached to X
		  (if 0, nulling section of sequence is omitted)
dn,dof		used to set 1H (observe) frequency
pw		90 degree pulse for protons
tn,tof		used to set X nucleus frequency
pwx		90 degree pulse for X nucleus at power level pwxlvl
dm		nny gives software waltz-4 decoupling of X during acquisition
		nnn gives coupled spectrum
pwxw		90 degree pulse for X nucleus decoupling at power level tpwr
nt		multiple of 2 minimum; 8 for best results
ss		number of steady-state transients;  if ss<0, then -ss
		 transients are performed before each increment (recommended
		 for calibration/setup experiments, not for 2D)
phase		1,2 for hypercomplex; 3 for TPPI
spin		Experiment must be performed non-spin for best results
