shimmult<(multiplier,'dacname')> - Adjust the radial shim dacs of the current shimset

 The shimmult macro will multiply the value of each radial dac in the
 current shimset by a multiplier.  One might use this macro if the
 current output by the shim power supply has changed. This macro does
 not load the new values into the hardware. Follow the shimmult macro
 with a call to "su" to set the hardware. This macro does not adjust
 axial dacs.

 The shimmult macro accepts two optional arguments. One is the multiplier
 and the other is a single radial dac name. Either one of both arguments
 can be used, in either order.  The default value for the multiplier is 1.0/1.5.
 Note also that shim dac values are integer values. Therefore, shimmult(1/3)
 followed by shimmult(3) may not give the original values, due to truncation
 effects.

Examples:
 shimmult           // Multiply all radial dacs by default multiplier of 1/1.5
 shimmult(1.5)      // Multiply all radial dacs by 1.5
 shimmult('xy')     // Multiply xy dac by 1/1.5
 shimmult('xy',1.5) // Multiply xy dac by 1.5
 shimmult(1.5,'xy') // Multiply xy dac by 1.5
