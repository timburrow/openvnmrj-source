  plhxcor   - plot X,H-correlation 2D spectrum	(M)
*******************************************************************************

  Syntax:	plhxcor<(levels<,spacing<,exp1D_H<,exp1D_X>>>)>
		plhxcor('pos',<levels<,spacing<,exp1D_H<,exp1D_X>>>>)
		plhxcor('neg',<levels<,spacing<,exp1D_H<,exp1D_X>>>>)

  Description:	"plhxcor" automatically plots 2D spectra of type hetcor, coloc,
		hmqc, hmbc (direct and indirect detection). Features:
		  - it keeps the orientation (f1, f2) of the spectrum on the
		    screen
		  - the plot area is optimized
		  - number of contour levels and their spacing can be selected
		  - negative or positive contours can be suppressed
		  - 1D proton and X traces can be plotted along both axes;
		    such 1D traces are taken from full (or reduced) 1D spectra
		    in other experiments
		  - it also works correctly for expansions
		  - the 1D traces can be suppressed, which allows it to use
		    a larger area for the 2D spectrum
		  - the 1D spectra can be in any experiment

		Arguments:
                  - 'pos': only plot positive contours
                  - 'neg': only plot negative contours
		  - levels: the number of contour levels; default: 7 contours.
		  - spacing: the spacing between the contours; default: 2.
		  - exp1D_H: the experiment in which the proton 1D spectrum
		    resides; this can be a full 1D spectrum, but the referen-
		    cing must be the same as for the 2D (see below). A nega-
		    tive number will suppress the proton trace. Default is
		    1 (exp1).
		  - exp1D_X: the experiment in which the "X" 1D spectrum
		    resides (see above); again, a negative number suppresses
		    the "X: trace. Default: 2 (exp2).

  Examples:	plhxcor			( equivalent to "plhxcor(7,2,1,2)" )
		plhxcor(12,1.5)		( equivalent to "plhxcor(12,1.5,1,2)" )
		plhxcor(7,2,3)		( equivalent to "plhxcor(7,2,3,2)" )
		plhxcor(7,2,1,3)
		plhxcor('pos',7,2,-1,3)
		plhxcor(7,2,-1,-1)
		plhxcor('neg')


  Usage:	A typical sequence of actions for acquiring and plotting a
		hetcor spectrum stepwise and in multiexperiment mode will be
	        as follows:
		  - acquire a proton spectrum in exp1
		  - enter the text and reference the spectrum NOW (before
		    moving the fid to an other experiment)
		  - acquire a C13 spectrum in exp2
		  - reference the spectrum NOW (again, before moving the fid
		    into an other experiment) and fetch the text from exp1
		    [ mt(1,2) ].
		  - mf(1,3) jexp3 wft ... movesw
		  - mf(2,4) jexp4 wft ... movesw
		  - call the macro for the 2D experiment (e.g., "hetcor") and
		    acquire the 2D spectrum
		  - process the 2D spectrum
		  - for plotting with traces type "plhxcor" (the defaults fit).
		  - for expansions select the expansion and type "plhxcor"
		    again.
