*********************************************************

This software allows post-acquistion digital filtering and downsampling
to selectively detect a region of a spectrum.  The digital filtered
and downsampled FID can then be saved to disk.  The digital filtering
and downsampling process are integrated into the ft and ft2d commands
and will occur when these commands are executed as specified by the
parameters below.  The digital filtering and downsampling are done
just prior to the Fourier transform, so all apodization, linear prediction,
solvent suppression, etc. are done prior to digital filtering.

To use this software, a data set should be acquired with
sw = N*(final desired sw) and np = N*(final desired np + dscoef/2).
Once a data set has been acquired, create the Vnmr parameters
necessary for digital filtering and downsampling.  The pards macro
creates all of the necessary parameters.  It is also called when
addpar('downsamp') is typed.

If a data set has been Fourier transformed normally, the movedssw
macro sets dslsfrq and downsamp to appropriate values for digitally
filtering and downsampling to select the region of the spectrum selected
by the cursors in the ds display.

The parameters created by pards include:

downsamp:

This parameter specifies the downsampling factor applied after
digital filtering.  The sw of the data set after digital filtering
and downsampling will be (acquired sw)/downsamp.  Setting downsamp
to 1 will allow digital filtering with a filter bandwidth specified
by "dsfb" (see below) without downsampling.  Setting downsamp to 'n'
will allow normal data processing in Vnmr without digital filtering.

dscoef:

This parameter specifies the number of coefficients used in the digital
filter.  The default is 61.  A larger number of coefficients will give
a filter with sharper cutoffs, and a smaller number of coefficients will
give a filter with more gradual cutoffs.  dscoef does not need to be
changed as downsamp is changed, as it is automatically adjusted by vnmr
to give filter cutoffs which are the same regardless of the value of
downsamp.  This is done by actually using dscoef*downsamp/2 coefficents
in the digital filter.  Vnmr always rounds dscoef*downsamp/2 to an odd
number.

dslsfrq:

This parameter is used to select a bandpass filter that is not centered
about the transmitter frequency.  dslsfrq is specified in Hz and works
much like lsfrq.  A positive value of dslsfrq will select a region upfield
from the transmitter frequency and a negative value will select a downfield
region.

dsfb:

This parameter specifies the bandwidth of the digital filter that is used.
If dsfb='n' it defaults to the final sw/2.  A smaller value will reject 
frequencies at the edges of the spectrum, and a larger value will alias
noise and signals at frequencies outside of +/- sw/2.

filtfile:

This parameter specifies the filename of a file of FIR digital filter
coefficients.  The file must be in the user's vnmrsys/filtlib directory.
The filter coefficient file is a text file with one real filter
coefficient per line.  Complex filters are not currently supported.
