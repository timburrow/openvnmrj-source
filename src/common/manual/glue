*******************************************************************************
glue - assemble related 1D datasets into a 2D (or pseudo-2D) dataset.
*******************************************************************************

This macro is used to artificially construct a 2D dataset from a series of 
1D datasets having similar filenames.  It is crucial to ensure that the 
exact format of the filenames of each of the 1D datasets is identical.

The macro requires the parameter savefile; savefile indicates the name of 
the directory which contains all the 1D datasets.  The macro reads in 
each 1D file, in succession, and adds it to the previous data, but in a 
2D format.

When completed, the total time of the experiment, which is read from the 
log files of each 1D dataset is used to adjust sw1.  This allows the t1 
axis of a dataset transformed by wft1da to have a time axis which 
corresponds to the LC retention time.

Arguments:
The default is to glue all the spectra stored in the current directory 
that have the proper filename format (from 1 through arraydim).  An 
optional argument (glue(##)) allows one to specify that only spectra 
from 1 through ## are to be glued.
