 dshapei - display pulse shape or modulation pattern interactively (M)
********************************************************************************

      Syntax: dshapei<(patternfile.ext)>

 Description: dshapei displays the real (X) and imaginary (Y) components of
	      a pulse shape, modulation pattern or gradient shape interac-
	      tively. This mode will overwrite the existing data (FID) 
	      after the permission is granted by the user. It also asks 
	      for the duration of the waveform and displays the timescale.

   Arguments: dshapei takes the shape or pattern (file) name as argument.
   	      The .ext is shapefile extension indicating the type of the 
              waveform (.RF, .DEC or .GRD). 
	      Absolute and relative filenames can be specified, as well as
	      simple pattern file names (in this case dshapei will first look
	      in the local directory, then in the user's shapelib, finally
	      in /vnmr/shapelib. If no filename is given, dshape displays 
	      the last created waveform.
