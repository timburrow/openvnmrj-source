flushpars:$res	- Write out parameters in VNMR memory
*************************************************************************

The VNMR program keeps parameters in memory buffers.  Normally, this
information is not written to disk until one exits VNMR or joins another
experiment.

Use this command to write out the "current" and "processed" parameter trees.
This command is used, for example, when parameters are transferred between
viewports.

The success or failure of this command can be returned to the calling macros.
The result will be returned as a 1 for success and 0 for failure. If no return
argument is given, and the flushpars commands fails for some reason, it will
abort the calling macro. If a return argument is given, it will not abort
the calling macro.
