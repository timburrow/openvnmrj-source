  "dli" displays a list of integrals at the integral reset points.
  The reset points are stored in the parameter "lifrq" and the integral
  amplitudes are stored in the parameter "liamp".
  The frequency units of the reset points are defined by the parameter
  axis.  The results of this calculation are stored in the parameters
  "lifrq" and "liamp".  The reset points are stored as hertz and are not
  referenced to "rfl" and "rfp".  The amplitudes are stored as the actual
  value; they are not scaled by parameters.

  To display the values of liamp, enter display('liamp').  Values of liamp
  can also be accessed in MAGICAL macros using, e.g., liamp[$i].
  liamp values are stored as absolute numbers (summations of data point values),
  and as such will be a function of fn.  The values which are displayed by the
  dli, pir, and dpir programs are related to the liamp values by the following
  equation:
         numeric integral VALUE = liamp[$i]*ins/insref/fn

  The parameter "ins" is the integral value of the reference integral. For
  example, if the reference integral is a methyl group, ins might be set to
  3.  The parameter insref is the Fourier number scaled value of the
  reference integral.  For example, insref would be set to something like
  liamp[$ref]/fn where the $ref selects the appropriate array value.
  With these definitions, for the selected reference integral (i.e., when
  $i = $ref), the above equation reduces to
        SUM of the DISPLAYED numeric integral VALUES = ins
  If insref is 0 or not defined, the reported integrals will be
        numeric integral VALUE = liamp[$i]*ins/fn
  The macro setint can be used to set the value of a reference integral.
  NOTE: The displayed integral trace is independent of ins and insref.
  Its amplitude is controlled by the parameter is.

  If insref is set to 'Not Used', (insref='n'), the normalized integrals
  are displayed.  In this case, ins represents the value of the sum of
  all the integrals.  The dlni macro displays normalized integrals by
  temporarily setting insref='n' and then calling dli.

  When the integral blanking mode is used, every other integral is displayed
  and listed.  Also, when the integral blanking mode is used with "dlni",
  every other integral is used in the summation. The summation includes integrals
  that are outside the current sp and wp range.

  "nli" is the equivalent of "dli" except that no screen display is produced.

  The command "z" puts an integral reset at the current cursor position.
  Specific frequencies can be specified as the reset points by passing
  them as arguments to the command "z".

  "cz" removes all currently defined integral reset points.  If
  arguments are supplied to "cz", then only those reset points
  corresponding to the specified frequencies are removed.
