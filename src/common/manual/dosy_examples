Several example 2D and 3D Dosy fids can be
processed with the new DOSY processing tools.
a, 31P dosy of AMP-ADP-ATP
b, DOSY-INEPT of a sugare mixture
c, DOSY_DQFCOSY of the same sugare mixture
d, DOSY_HMQC from G. Morris from his original publication.

The Dosy experiment is documented in the "User Guide: Liquids NMR"
manual.  Individual Dosy commands are documented in the
"VNMR Command and Parameter Reference" manual.
Here are some hints on how to process the example data sets.

********************************************************************************

P31:
             commands                    	Buttons in Process window
        cd to fidlib/P31
	recall the fid (Dbppste_36C)
        transform the data (wft, lb=2)		Process 
        do baseline correction (fbc)		Baseline correct All spectra
	adjust the treshold	
        call "dosy" 				Calculate full DOSY spectrum

To have better diffusion resolution, you may calculate a partial dosy spectrum
with diffusion limits:

recall the original data:
	undosy					Recall original NMR data
	dosy(6,7)				Calculate partial DOSY spectrum
							within the limits below
To display (and plot) the diffusion spectrum, you must join an other experiment
(with no unsaved important data!!!) and type:sdp

********************************************************************************

DOSY-INEPT:
             commands                           Buttons in Process window
        cd to fidlib/sugars
        recall the fid (Dbppsteinept)
	transform the data (ft) 		Process (unset lb and gf)
		no wft for proper resol.
        do baseline correction (fbc)            Baseline correct All spectra
	lb=-0.4 gf=0.7 				set lb and gf

expand the spectrum and put the two cursors around the most intense line 
(dioxane) +/- 15 Hz

	fiddle					FIDDLE
	display full spectrum
	set treshold
	dosy					Calculate full DOSY spectrum

To have better diffusion resolution, you may calculate a partial dosy spectrum
with diffusion limits:

recall the original data:
        undosy                                  Recall original NMR data        
        dosy(2.0,5.5)                           Calculate partial DOSY spectrum
                                                        within the limits below

To display (and plot) the diffusion spectrum, you must join an other experiment
(with no unsaved important data!!!) and type:sdp

DOSY-COSY:
             commands                           Buttons in Process2 window
        cd to fidlib/sugars
        recall the fid (Dgstecosy)

transform the firt FID:

	wft2d(1)				Retransform the 1st 2D spectrum

The signal regions for this file have already been saved.
You need to recall the ll2d file, provided with the fid. Providing you are still
in fidlib/sugars:

        ll2d('read','Dgstecosy.ll2d')			-

If you have an error message: Peak file not found, then go to the following 
menus: Peak/Auto/Volume and repeat the ll2d('read',.........) again.
You can check that this step was succesful by:

        ll2dmode='nnyn' dconi			Labeling options ..... nnyn
						Redisplay spectrum

Each cross peak is boxed, the cross peak fine structure is disregarded.
Perform the dosy analyses:

	dosy					Calculate DOSY spectrum

When ready and the cosy spectrum is displayed again, (with a lot of numbers,
the diffusion coefficients and their error) join another experiment
and display the diffusion spectrum (sdp). You will see a banch of signals
	4.2-4.8  m2/sec   -  1,3,5,-O-Mrthylidyne-mio-Inosytol
	3.6-3.9  m2/sec   -  Methyl-alfa-D-glucopyranosid
	2.8-3.1  m2/sec   -  sucrose
the other 3 lines between 3.2 and 3.6 are overlaping diagonal peaks.
Rejoin the DOSY experiment. To display the inosytol spectrum:

	ll2dmode='nnnn'				Labeling ........ nnnn
 						Redisplay spectra
	makeslice(4.2,4.8)			Show 2D projection within ...
							Low. lim: 4.2
							Up. lim : 4.8	

To calculate (or display the glucose projection, you need to recall the original 
data:

	showoriginal			      Show original 2D (first spectrum)
        makeslice(3.6,3.9)                      Show 2D projection within ...

                                                        Up. lim : 3.9

To calculate (or display the sucrose projection):

        showoriginal                          Show original 2D (first spectrum)               
        makeslice(2.8,3.1)                      Show 2D projection within ...  
                                                        Low. lim: 2.8  
                                                        Up. lim : 3.1

(Please note that some diagonal peaks are missing from the spectrum, due to
signal overlap.)
