shimset<(shim_index)><:$label> - Display or return the shim tube label.

 In the "config" window, one can select the shim tube that is present in the
 system. This information is stored in the "systemglobal" shimset parameter.
 The shimset macro will translate the shimset index back into a descriptive
 text of the shim tube.

 If no argument is supplied, the label of the current shim tube is displayed.
 If an index is given, the label for that index is displayed.

 If the macro is called with a return value, the return set is set to the
 label and no message is displayed.

Examples
 shimset         // Displays "Current shim tube: Agilent 28 (51mm)
 shimset(19)     // Displays "Shim tube index 19: Agilent 28 Thin (51mm)
 shimset:$label  // sets $label='Agilent 28 (51mm)'
