writefile	write formatted text to a file
******************************************************************************

The writefile command is similar to the write command, except that it only writes to a text file.
It also requires formatted text as input. The benefit it that it can be faster than the
write command if one is writing a lot of text to the file.

writefile('open','filename'):$e    Open a file for writing. The file will be created if it does not
exist. The current contents will be removed if it does exist. An optional return argument will
be set to 1 if the operation succeeded. It will be set to 0 if it failed.

writefile('append','filename'):$e    Open a file for writing. The file will be created if it does not
exist. The current contents will be appended to if it does exist. An optional return argument will
be set to 1 if the operation succeeded. It will be set to 0 if it failed.

write('line','formatted text line to write to the file')  Write a line of text to the previously opened
file. A carriage return will automatically be added at the end of the supplied line.

writefile('close')  Close the file. Until this step is done, other commands that may access the file, such
as the lookup command, may give un-reliable results.

An example of the usage is shown below. It assumes the $re and $im parameters have been set to the
real and imaginary components of a data set. It uses the 'line3' option of the write command to
format the text line for the writefile command.

writefile('open',curexp+'/textData')
$i=0
$line=''
while ($i < np) do
  $i = $i + 1
  write('line3','%0.4f %0.1f',$re[$i],$im[$i]):$line
  writefile('line',$line)
endwhile
writefile('close')
