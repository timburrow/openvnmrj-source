************************************************************************

To set up a Hadamard experiment, do the following.
     1) First run a Proton, Carbon, or other 1D experiment.
     2) When the acquisition is finished, process and phase the
          spectrum.  
     3) Run the editht macro to open the Edit HT Freq popup.
          Create a Hadamard frequency list for the nucleus
          of interest.  Save the frequency list.  
     4) For a heteronuclear Hadamard experiment, run a Proton
          experiment, and adjust spectral width and decoupling
          as desired.  
     5) Load the desired Hadamard experiment.  Check the
          Hadamard frequency list and other parameters.
     6) Start the acquisition of the Hadamard experiment.
     7) When acquisition is complete, process with
          proc1='ht' wft2da.


Parameters used:
htfrq1  - Hadamard frequency list in indirect dimension.
ni      - Number of increments in indirect dimension.  
             Typically set to the size of htfrq1 plus htofs1.
htofs1  - Offset in Hadamard processing (number of increments
             to skip).
proc1   - Type of processing in indirect dimension.  Set to 'ht'.
fn1     - Fourier number in indirect dimension.  It must be larger
             than the number of Hadamard frequencies, and larger
             than the minimum difference between Hadamard frequencies.

Hadamard Spectroscopy

Hadamard spectroscopy is a technique for acquiring multidimensional
data sets using a small number of transients, and reconstructing
the nD spectrum using a Hadamard transform.  It is based on selective
excitation of a predetermined set of frequencies.


Acquisition.

A list of frequencies to selectively excite is determined from a 1D
spectrum, or other means.  A series of shaped pulses is created from
the frequency list, using a Hadamard matrix to selectively excite or
invert the signals of interest.  The matrix size must be greater than
the number of frequencies in the list.  A typical 8x8 Hadamard matrix is
shown below.

Processing.

Hadamard processing in the indirect dimension is done by summing,
adding or subtracting the acquired data increments in combinations
according to the Hadamard matrix elements.  Each sum gives a trace
corresponding to one of the frequencies in the list, and is placed
at the appropriate frequency in the indirect dimension.  The areas
between the frequencies in the list are zero filled.  The direct
dimension is Fourier transformed, giving the 2D spectrum.
