shell	               -  start a shell
shell('command'):$ans  -  run the UNIX "command" and return answer to magical
*******************************************************************************

  This command brings up a normal Unix shell for the user.  On the Sun,
  a pop-up window is created.  On the GraphOn, the entire terminal is
  used.

  shell('unix command and arguments') executes a Unix command.
  Text lines which would be displayed as a result of the command supplied
  to "shell" can instead be returned to magical as output variables.
  A single display line gets put into a single output variable.
  If the last character in the command line to shell is an '&',  the
  command will be executed in background.  That is,  Vnmr commands may
  be entered and executed while the "shell" command is still running.
  Note that if this background feature is used,  one should redirect
  any printed output to a file.  Otherwise,  the output may pop up in
  the text window a random times.

  Usage  -  shell
  shell('ls'):$file1,$file2,$file3
  shell(systemdir+'/acqbin/Acqstat '+hostname+' &')
