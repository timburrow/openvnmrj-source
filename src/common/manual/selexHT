selexHT: test sequence for Hadamard excitation.

Requires a frequency list from the htfrq1 parameter.
The list is generated, for example by recording a 1D spectrum, 
setting a proper threshhold and executing the dll macro, followed
by selexHT and sethtfrq1. The multiplet structure can be 
smoothed out by setting lb = htbw1 or slightly less.

parameters:
==========
htfrq1 - list of frequencies for Hadamard encoding.
ni     - number of increments. Must be a power of 2. Other allowed values 
         are n*12, n*20 and n*28, where n is a power of 2.
nimax  - sets limit to ni to prevent unrealistic experiments.
htofs1 - ni offset. Sets the number of increments to be omitted. Typical
         value is htofs1 = 1.
htbw1  - excitation bandwidth. For pshape = 'gaus180' good numbers are 
         90, 45, 30 or 20 Hz.
pshape - shape used for Hadamard encoding, typically gaus180, square180,
         sinc180.
ptype  - excitation type: 'i' (inversion), 's' (sequential inversion), 
         'e' (excitation) and 'r' (refocusing). The pshape must be set 
         accordingly.
pxbss  - Bloch-Siegert correction for Hadamard encoding, typically set 
         pxbss = 'y'.
pxrep  - set pxrep = 'n' to suppress Pbox reports. pxrep = 'h' prints
         Hadamard matrix only.
htss1  - stepsize for Hadamard encoding pulses. This parameter is adjusted
         by looking at the maximum phase increments in Hadamard enconing
         pulses, e.g. F1_2.RF. If unsure, set htss1 = 0 to disable it.
compH  - H-1 amplifier compression factor.                     
htcal1 - allows calibration of selective pulses. Set mix=0, htcal1=ni, 
         ni=0 and array htpwr1. If ni=12 (and other that are not a power of 
         two) use htcal1=8. Adjust compH so that pulse power matches the 
         optimum power found from the calibration.
