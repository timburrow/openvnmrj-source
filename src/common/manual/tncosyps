 tncosyps - homonuclear correlation   (phase-sensitive version)
            uses transmitter solvent saturation

 Parameters:

      p1 = 90 degree pulse on the observe nucleus
      pw = x degree pulse on the observe nucleus 
           x:  90 degrees for standard COSY experiment
  satdly = length of saturation period;
  sspul  = 'y' for trim(x)-trim(y) before d1
           (recommended for suppression of F1 artifacts coming from
           T1's long with respect to repetition time

      ss = number of steady state pulses; if ss < 0 then -ss
           steady-state transients are performed before EVERY increment;
           if ss > 0, then ss steady-state transients are performed
           before only the first increment.

   phase =   0:  non-phase-sensitive experiment  (P-type peak selection)
           1,2:  phase-sensitive HYPERCOMPLEX experiment
             3:  phase-sensitive TPPI experiment
      nt = (min):  multiple of 4   (phase = 0)
                   multiple of 2   (phase = 1,2 or 3)
           (max):  multiple of 8   (phase = 0)
                   multiple 0f 4   (phase = 1,2 or 3)

NOTE: the tncosyps pulse sequence is not supplied with Mercury and GEMINI 2000.
