readheader(filename):$pts,$blks,$traces - Display or return data block header information

 All VnmrJ data files have header files that describe the data in the file.
 See the User Programming manual for details about the file structure.
 The readheader command reads this header file and returns the number of points
 in each block, the number of blocks, and the number of traces in a block.
 For FID data files, the number of points corresponds to the value of the np
 parameter. The number of blocks corresponds to the arraydim parameter. The
 number of traces corresponds to the value of the nf parameter (it is 1 if nf
 does not exist).

 The readheader command takes a single argument that is the pathname of the
 data file. It will return the points, blocks, and traces, in that order, to
 the calling macro.

Examples
 readheader(curexp+'/acqfil/fid'):$pt,$blk    // Returns points and blocks of
                                              // the FID in the current experiment
