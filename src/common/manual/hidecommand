hidecommand	- 	rename a builtin Vnmr command so that a macro with
                        this same name will be executed

  Usage -- hidecommand(commandname)<:$newname>
           hidecommand('?')

  hidecommand will rename a builtin command.  For example, suppose
  one wants to write a macro named 'svs' which saves shims to a 
  pre-defined directory.  When svs is entered, the list of
  builtin commands is searched first, and the svs command which
  saves shims in the shims directory will be called instead of the
  custom svs macro.
  hidecommand('svs') will rename the builtin 'svs' command so that the
  macro will be executed.  If a return argument is appended to the
  hidecommand command, it will be set to the new name of the builtin
  command.  Calling hidecommand with the new name of a hidden builtin
  command will reset the builtin command to it's original name.

  hidecommand('?') displays a list of all of the renamed builtin commands
  and the original names.
  
  hidecommand may have several possible uses.  One may be to permanently
  remove access to a command.  For example, perhaps the rm command
  is not desired.  This could be removed for all users be including the line
  hidecommand('rm') in the system bootup macro. Alternatively, it could be
  removed for selected uses by putting the same line in the user's login macro.
  Another use would be for a macro to temporarily disable a command. For
  example, consider the following five macro lines.

  hidecommand('svs'):$newname
  svs
  exec($newname)
  hidecommand($newname)
  svs

  The first hides the builtin command svs.  The second calls a user's svs
  macro.  The third calls the builtin svs command with it's new name.
  The fourth resets the builtin command to its original svs name.
  The fifth calls the builtin svs command with it's original svs name.
  
  Programming note: The command is hidden by changing the case of the first
  letter of the command.  That is, the builtin svs command is hidden by renaming
  it to Svs.  Access is still available to the builtin command with the new
  name.
