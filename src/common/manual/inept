                     INEPT   EXPERIMENT

j       coupling constant (0 allows direct entry of d2 and d3)
pw      90 degree pulse on observe nucleus
pp      90 degree pulse on protons using decoupler
pplvl   power level for proton decoupler pulse   (with linear amplifiers)
mult    multiplicity; 0 gives a normal experiment (d1-pw-at sequence);
        2 selects ch's (doublets); 3 gives ch2's down, ch's and ch3's up;
        4 enhances all protonated carbons
dm      'nny' gives decoupled spectrum;
        'nnn' gives coupled spectrum
dmm     'ccw' or 'ccf'
focus   'y' gives refocussing for coupled spectrum (decoupled spectra are
        always refocussed)
normal  'y' gives normal multiplets in coupled spectra


NOTE:	delay "d1" is needed for protons to relax

NOTE:   If the decoupler channel uses a linear amplifier, PPLVL is
	the power level for the proton decoupler pulse and DPWR, the
	power level for broadband proton decoupling.  If the decoupler
	channel uses a class C amplifier, maximum power is used for
	the proton decoupler pulse and DHP specifies the power level
	for broadband proton decoupling.
