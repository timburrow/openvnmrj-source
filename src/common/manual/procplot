      Syntax: procplot<(pltmod)>

 Description: "procplot" is a universal fid processing macro; it is normally
	      called through wexp='procplot' by automatic acquisition macros
	      like h1, c13, hcapt, hcosy, etc.; its purpose is not the data
	      processing itself, but rather the selection of the appropriate
	      processing macro for a given data set.
	      First, "procplot" calls a macro "process" that calculates spectra;
	      that macro by itself will then select an appropriate processing
	      macro, like "proc1d" for non-arrayed 1D spectra.
	      Depending whether the parameter "pltmod" is set to 'none' or not,
	      "procplot" will then call "plot", a universal plotting macro. The
	      setting of "pltmod" can be temporarily overridden by specifying
	      an alternative value as argument to "procplot".
	      One of the concepts behind the "procplot" macro is that the user
	      should never have to modify any processing macro when for custo-
	      mizing the processing or the output of automatic experiments or
	      processing; this can happen simply by selecting a parameter in
	      the calling macro or before calling "procplot".

   Arguments: "pltmod" is an alternate value for the parameter "pltmod" that
	      will only be used for the current call. The values 'none' and
	      'off' will suppress plotting. The range of possible (active)
	      values for "pltmod" depends on the plotting macros; often, the
	      parameter "pltmod" will have no effect other than turning on or
	      off plotting. Note: if only the calculation of a spectrum is
	      desired it is usually simpler to call the "process" macro.

    Examples: procplot
	      procplot('none')
