   Description:	This macro converts a 1D-s2pul parameter set into a parameter
		set ready to run either a Pulsed Field Gradient AV ROESY
		experiment, or a tnroesy experiment.	

    Parameters:	
        gzlvl1 = gradient amplitude (-32768 to +32768; use 3000)
        gt1 = gradient time (duration) in seconds (0.0015)
        gzlvl2 = gradient amplitude (-32768 to +32768; use 3000)
        gt2 = gradient time (duration) in seconds (0.0015)
        grise = gradient rise and fall time (in seconds; 0.00001)
        gstab = optional delay for stability (in seconds)
        phase = 1 (selects P-type coherence selection; default)
              = 2 (selects N-type coherence selection)

        p1 = 90 degree pulse on protons (power level at "p1lvl")
        pw = small (30 degree) pulse on protons (active only if ratio > 0)
             if pw=0, pw is set to p1/3
     p1lvl = power level for the p1 pulse
      tpwr = power level for the spin lock pulse(s)
     ratio = tau/pw (uses cw lock if ratio is zero)
     phase = 1,2: F1 quadrature by the hypercomplex method
              (uses F1 axial peak displacement)
               3: F1 quadrature by the TPPI method
       mix = mixing time
     sspul = 'y': selects for trim(x)-trim(y) sequence at start of pulse sequence
    rocomp = 'n': no resonance offset compensation
             'y': resonance offset compensation (recommended)
  satmode  = saturation mode. Use analogously to dm, i.e. satmode='nnn' or
             satmode='ynn' or  satmode='yyn' (recommended)
    satdly  = length of saturation during relaxation delay
   satpwr  = power level for solvent saturation
        nt = min:  multiple of 2
             max:  multiple of 8  (recommended)
   d2corr  = empirical correction(in us) of d2 (dependent on effective field of
             spin lock, i.e. TPWR and/or RATIO). It can be determined from the
             lp1 and sw1 values from a properly phased spectrum by the relation
 
                    d2corr = (lp1*1e6)/(360*sw1)
 
             Note that the d2corr seems to be dependent on sw1. It is independent
             of sw1 since changes in sw1 result in corresponding changes in lp1
             so that their ratio is constant.
 
        Procedure for finding d2corr(so that lp1 will = 0, giving better
             baselines in F1):
                1. Run a tnroesy experiment with d2corr set either at 0 or at a
                   value found previously. (nt and ni can be smaller, and the
                   spectrum may be transformed early to do step 2)
                2. Phase the resulting spectrum in F1. Determine lp1 and
                   calculate d2corr from the above relationship.
                3. Add this value to the value of d2corr used in step 1.
                4. Rerun the experiment and lp1 should be close to zero.
                5. Note this value for any future experiment with the same
                   value of tpwr and ratio.

    Use of any method to make lp1=0 will result in a dc offset of F1 slices. This   should be removed by dc2d('f1') after the 2d transform. Enough noise should
   be left on the edges (in F1) to permit this dc correction.
 

        process N-type data with wft2d(1,0,0,1)
        process P-type data with wft2d(1,0,0,-1)
                   the ('t2dc') arguement to wft2d may be useful

NOTE: the gtnroesy pulse sequence is not supplied with Mercury and GEMINI 2000.
