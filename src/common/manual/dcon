dcon	-	Display Contour Plot (Color Intensity Map)
dconn	-	Same, but do not erase screen  before starting to display
*******************************************************************************

  A "contour plot", actually a color intensity map, is produced on the screen.
  "sp", "wp", "sp1" and "wp1" control, which portion of the spectrum is
  displayed. "sc", "wc", "sc2" and "wc2" control where on the screen the
  display occurs. Data is shown in different colors on color screens, and in
  black and white on black and white screens. The parameter th is active as a
  threshold to black out all contours whose intensity is below th. That is, if
  th=7, the colors 1 to 6 will not be used for the display. vs controls the
  vertical scale of the spectrum. 
  The following key words can be used as arguments:
     linear	display in linear instead of logarithmic increments
     phcolor	use phased color set, display positive and negative peaks
     avcolor    use absolute value color set, display positive peaks only
     gray	use gray scale color set	
     noaxis     do not outline the display nor draw the horizontal nor
                vertical axes.
     plot       cause the dcon display to be sent to the plotter instead
                of being drawn on the graphics screen.
