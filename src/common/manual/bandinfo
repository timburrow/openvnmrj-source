MACROS 

    pulseinfo<(name, pulsewidth <,refpower>)>
    bandinfo<(name, bandwidth <,refpower>)>

    pulseinfo and bandinfo operate either interactively or from another
    macro.  Pulseinfo gets the name of the shape and the duration of
    pulse and returns the bandwidth of that pulse and a predicted 90 degree
    pulse power setting.  Bandinfo gets the name of the shape, the bandwidth
    desired for the pulse and returns the duration of that pulse and a 
    predicted 90 degree pulse power setting. If the macros are run 
    interactively (i.e. without arguments), a table with the desired data
    is printed.  If run with arguments, either bandwidth or pulsewidth
    is returned in the first argument and the suggested 90 degree pulse
    power levels in the second.  All of the necessary data is contained
    in the shapelib/shapeinfo file in the VNMR system directory.  Power
    calculations are based on the assumption that pw90 is set for a tpwr
    of 55.  The refpower argument allows the 55 dB default to be changed.
    All times are in microseconds and bandwidths are in Hz.

    Example:
    pulseinfo
    pulse name? gauss
    pulse width? 1000

    prints out a table with name, pulse width, bandwidth and 90 and 180
    power levels. It changes no parameter settings.

    bandinfo('sinc',1000):pw,tpwr
    returns the pulsewidth in pw and the 90 degree power level in tpwr
