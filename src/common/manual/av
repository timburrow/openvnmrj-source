The commands ph, av, pwr, and pa operate by setting the parameter dmg 
to a particular value.  ph sets dmg = 'ph'; av, dmg = 'av'; pwr, dmg = 
'pwr'; and pa, dmg = 'pa'.

In the phased mode, which is selected by ph, each real point in the dis-
played 1D spectrum is calculated from a linear combination of the REAL
and IMAGINARY points comprising each respective 1D complex data point.
The coefficients for this linear combination are derived from the phase
parameters "rp" and "lp".

In the absolute value mode, which is selected by av, each real point in
the displayed 1D spectrum is calculated as the square root of the sum
of the squares of the REAL and IMAGINARY points comprising each respec-
tive 1D complex data point.  In this mode, all information, including
noise, is always positive; and the relationship between signal and noise
is linear.

In the power mode, which is selected by pwr, each real point in the dis-
played 1D spectrum is calculated as the sum of the squares of the REAL
and IMAGINARY points comprising each respective 1D complex data point.
In this mode, all information, including noise, is always positive;
and the relationship between signal and noise is non-linear.

In the phase angle mode, which is selected by pa, each real point in the 
displayed 1D spectrum is calculated from the arctangent phase angle of 
the REAL and IMAGINARY points comprising each respective 1D complex data 
point.  The phase angle also includes the phase parameters "rp" and "lp".

For 2D data, only the command ph has an effect on the data prior to the
second ft if pmode = 'partial' or pmode = ''.  If pmode = 'full', ph, av,
pwr, and pa act in concert with ph1, av1, pwr1, and pa1 to yield the 
resultant contour display for the 2D data.
