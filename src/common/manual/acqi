*******************************************************************************

   The interactive acquisition display process (acqi) allows interactive
   locking and interactive shimming on the lock signal or FID or Spectrum.
   The pulse sequence and parameter set for the FID / SPECTRUM display may be
   selected by typing gf or go('acqi') from Vnmr.  Note that if clicking the
   FID button in acqi causes acqi to "disconnect",  the common cause is
   that gf or go('acqi') had not been executed from Vnmr.  When acqi is called
   from Vnmr, the success or failure may be returned to the caller. In
   this case, no warnings are displayed on line three.

   The FID display is also controlled by the parameters 'lsfid',  'phfid',
   and 'dmgf'.  These display parameters are automatically sent to acqi
   when acqi is first invoked.  These parameters may subsequently be
   changed and sent again to acqi with the command acqi('par').  If 'phfid'
   is not set to "Not Used" for the FID display in acqi, then a slider will
   be available in acqi for the interactive adjustment of the 'phfid'
   parameter.  The slider will be in the IPA set of adjustments.

   If the parameter "dmgf" exists and is set to "av",  then the FID display
   in acqi will display the square root of the sum of the squares of the
   real and imaginary channels.  The parameter dmgf has no function outside
   of the acqi program.  This display mode may cause the displayed FID
   to exceed the displayed ADC limits in acqi by as much as a factor of
   root two.

   The SPECTRUM display is also controlled by the parameters 'sp',  'wp',
   'dmg', 'rp', 'lp', 'rfl', 'rfp', 'vs', 'vp', 'sw', and 'fn'.  These
   parameters are automatically sent to acqi when acqi is first invoked.
   These parameters may subsequently be changed and sent again to acqi with
   the command acqi('par').  The preparation macro "gf" (see below) also
   calls acqi('par'),  thereby causing these parameters to be sent to acqi.
   If 'fn' is greater than 64K,  it will be lower to 64K.

   A convenient method of setting these parameters is to acquire a spectrum
   with go, then ft and adjust the display with the "ds" command options.
   Once the display is set the way you want it,  type "gf".  The same display
   should then appear when the SPECTRUM display is selected from acqi.  Note
   that weighting parameters are not used in the acqi SPECTRUM display.

   acqi('standby') starts acqi and puts it into the standby mode.  In
   this mode, a button labeled Acqi is present in Vnmr's permanent menu.
   Acqi may be disconnected or exited with the Vnmr commands acqi('disconnect')
   and acqi('exit'),  respectively.  acqi('disconnect') is the functional
   equivalent of clicking the close button;  this puts acqi in the standby
   mode.

   gf is a macro which can serve as a model for preparing parameters for the
   FID / SPECTRUM display in acqi.  The standard version of this macro turns off
   phase cycling,  autoshimming,  autolocking, spin control, temperature
   control, robot control, and autogain.  It also selects the current pulse
   sequence and parameter set by issuing the command go('acqi') and the
   command acqi('par').  The automation parameters cp,  wshim,  alock,  spin,
   temp, loc,  and gain are then reset to their original values.  Users may
   wish to customize this macro by copying it into their private maclib and
   editing that version to suit their needs.
