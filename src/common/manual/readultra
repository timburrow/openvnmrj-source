readultra(file_number)     -  read a shim coil setting from UltraShim unit

*******************************************************************************

  The UltraShims unit has a floppy disk which contains up to 63 shim sets.
  These are named file1.dac to file63.dac.  These can be recalled into Vnmr
  with the readultra macro.

  To read a specific shim set into your current experiment, use readultra
  with the number of the shim set as the argument.  For example, readultra(6)
  will read the shims from file6.dac on the floppy disk into your current
  experiment. To read all of the shim sets from the floppy, use readultra
  with no arguments.  The shim sets will be saved in the directory that the
  svs command would put them and will be given the name usfile1 to usfile63.

  In order for this macro to function, the floppy disk from the UltraShim
  unit has to be mounted on the Sun.  The procedure to do this differs
  between SunOS and Solaris.

  For SunOS:

    The floppy disk is expected to be mounted as /pcfs on the Sun.  From
    a separate shelltool, switch to the UNIX root account with the su
    command, insert the floppy into the drive and type the UNIX command

    #  mount /pcfs

    After finished with the readultra command, the floppy disk can be
    removed from the Sun drive by typing the following commands in a
    separate shelltool.  These must be typed from the UNIX root account.

    #  umount /pcfs
    #  eject


  For Solaris:

    The volume manager must be active.  This is the default configuration.
    To verify this, enter the Solaris command "ps -ef" and look for a
    process running vold.  For example:

    solaris: 1>ps -ef | grep vold
        root   214     1 80   Nov 01 ?        0:02 /usr/sbin/vold
    solaris: 2>

    Contact your system administrator if the volume manager is not active
    on your Solaris system.

    After inserting the Ultrashims floppy, enter the command "volcheck"
    from a separate shelltool.  Do NOT become root or superuser; use the
    same account that is running VNMR.  Once you are finished with the
    Ultrashims floppy, enter the command "eject" from the same shelltool.
    This will eject the floppy from its drive and allow you to remove it.
