  DSCALE displays a scale under a spectrum or FID.  The scale is positioned
  5 mm below the position of the spectrum or FID.  PSCALE plots the scale.
  To plot a FID scale, the first argument to PSCALE must be 'fid'.  The
  fid, rev, axis, color, and label options must preceed the vp0, sp0, and
  wp0 options in the argument list to dscale and pscale.

  Options
     rev  - reverses the direction of the scale.  That is, the smaller numbers
            will be at the left side of the scale.  If used, 'rev' must be the
            first argument.
     axis - If the letter p, h, k, etc. is supplied, it will be used instead
            of the current value of the parameter "axis".  For an FID scale,
            if the letter s, m, or u is supplied,  it will be used instead
            of the current value of the parameter "axisf".
     label- If a string of 2 or more characters is supplied, it will be used
            as the axis label.
     vp0  - This is supplied as the first real number. It defines the vertical
            position where the scale is drawn.  The default is 5 mm below
            the current value of the parameter "vp".
     sp0  - This is supplied as the second real number. It is a modified start
            of plot. If, for example, the display is from 347 to 447 hz, but
            the scale is desired to read 0 to 100 hz., sp0 would be input as 0.
     wp0  - This is supplied as the third real number. It is a modified width
            of plot. If, for example, the display is from 347 to 447 hz, but
            the scale is desired to read 0 to 550 Units. sp0 would be input as
            0, wp0 would be 550, and the label would be 'Units'.
     vscale - display vertical axis for 1D fid or spectrum. Repeat dscale('vscale') 
	    to toggle on/off vertical axis display.

  An optional color or pen number can be supplied to dscale or pscale.  The
  available colors and pens are:
        'red','green','blue','cyan','magenta','yellow','black','white'
        'pen1','pen2','pen3', ..., 'pen8'
