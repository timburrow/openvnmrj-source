These macros can be used both to process 2D FID data and to process 2D
planes at particular t1 or t2 times from a 3D data set for a pure absorp-
tive display.  (w)ft1da functions analogously to (w)ft2da except that the
former performs only the F2 FT.  wft1da and wft2da differ from ft1da and
ft2da only in that weighting of the time-domain data is performed prior
to the FT in the case of the former two macros.  The following arguments
may be used with these macros in any order:

	'ntype'
	'old'
	'bc',<bcorder>
	'dc'
	't2dc'
	't2dc'
	'f2sel'
	'ni',<ni2_element>
	'ni2',<ni_element>
        string of coefficients


The arguments 'ntype', 't2dc', 't1dc', 'f2sel', 'ni2', and
'ni' effect the same function as when supplied to the (w)ft2d command.
The 'bc' argument must be followed immediately by the polynomial order
to be used in the baseline correction of the F2 spectra prior to the F1 FT.
The default value for the polynomial order is 1, which leads to a spline
fit.  The 'dc' argument leads to a drift correction (DC) of the F2 spectra
prior to the F1 FT.  The arguments 'ni' and 'ni2' must be followed imme-
diately by the ni2 or ni element number, respectively, indicating which
2D plane is to be processed out of the 3D FID data set.  The argument
'old' does not function for selective 2D processing within 3D data sets.
If no ni2 or ni element number is given, it is assumed that the data set
is only 2D in either ni2 or ni, respectively.

The argument 'old' allows data acquired before the Feb. 25, 1988 VNMR
software release to be processed correctly but will not allow a bc2d
between the F2 and F1 FT's.

The argument 'bc', optionally followed by the order of the polynomial
baseline correction, effects a baseline correction on the phase-corrected
F2 spectra prior to the F1 FT.  Note that the "baseline" regions must
have been previously determined.

These macros function for both hypercomplex 2D FID data (phase = 1,2)
and TPPI 2D FID data (phase = 3 or phase = 1,4) acquired either with ni
or ni2.  If the data were acquired with ni, no additional argument need
be used with these macros.  If the data were acquired with ni2, the
argument 'ni2' must be used.
	

For phase = 1,2:    wft2da  =  wft2d('ptype',1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0)
                               wft2d('ptype',1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1)  ('old' argument)

For phase =   3:    wft2da  =  wft2d(1,0,0,0)

For phase = 1,4:    wft2da  =  wft2d('ptype',1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0)

These macros can be used to process arrayed 2D data sets.
A single array index can be supplied, as in wft2da(1).  For hyper-complex
2D FID data, the f1coef parameter will be used to supply the
combination coefficients. Alternatively, the combination coefficients
can be supplied as a string argument, in the same format as the f1coef parameter.
An example is wft2da('1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0'). Any supplied coefficient argument
will take precedence over the f1coef parameter.

(w)ft1da and (w)ft2da support selective 2D processing within a 3D FID
data set.  All permutations of hypercomplex and TPPI modes of data acqui-
sition in t1 and t2 can be handled.  For selective F2F3 processing, the
numeric argument immediately following the 'ni2' argument is interpreted
to be the t1 increment number, which specifies the particular F2F3 plane
to be processed.  For selective F1F3 processing, the t2 increment number
either follows the argument 'ni', which is optional, or is associated
with the first numeric argument that does not immediately follow a 'bc'
argument.
