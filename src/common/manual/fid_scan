*******************************************************************************

   The interactive acquisition display process allows interactive
   shimming on the FID or spectrum.  The pulse sequence and parameter
   set for the FID / spectrum display is whatever is set in the current
   experiment / workspace. The normal interactive tools for FID and
   spectral displays (df and ds commands) are available in this interactive
   mode. Automatic locking, shimming, steady states, and robot control
   are turned off by passing the 'fidscan' argument to the au command..

   The mechanism used for this interactive display is based on the au /
   wbs tools. The fid_scan macro does an au with the bsclear and fidscan
   arguments and sets wbs='fid_display'.  The fid_display macro does the
   actual data display at block size intervals. The fidscanmode parameter
   controls the type of display to use. It is a list of flag characters to
   select various options. Possible values for the "fidscanmode" parameter
   include:
     'r'  - displays the reals (as a trace, not in "filled" mode)
     'i'  - displays the imaginaries
     'ri' - displays both the reals and the imaginaries
     'f'  - displays the FID in "filled" mode. In this mode,
            the 'envelope' and 'dots' mode (see dotflag parameter)
            are not available.
     'rf' - display the "reals" in "filled" mode.
     's'  - displays the spectrum
     'e'  - displays the envelope
    
   By default, a block size of 1 is used for fidscan mode. However, this
   can be changed by creating and setting a 'fidshimnt' parameter. Setting
   the fidshimnt=1 has the special effect of turning automatic phase cycling
   (i.e., oph) off.  Setting fidshimnt=8, for example, will average 8 scans
   before the result is displayed.
