CARBONecho: 1D 13C dataset with a double echo from bip pulses to allow delayed
            data acquisition without the need for linear back prediction.

USAGE

This experiment is highly specialized to acquire 1D carbon data on a high
Q probe, such as a 13C cold probe, which may have long pulse ringdown
times. All parameters are set from the “Acquire” tab/”Default C13” panel
unless otherwise specified.
