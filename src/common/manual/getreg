  "region" divides a spectrum into alternating regions of baseline
  and regions of peaks.  The regions are delineated with integral
  reset points.  The optional arguments have the following functions :
      taillength - The length in Hz which will be added to the start and
		   end of each calculated peak region.  If the addition of
		   these wings would cause overlap between adjacent regions,
		   the wings will be reduced until the regions no longer
		   overlap.  The range for this argument is 0.0 to SW.
		   The default is SW/100.
      relnum - In combination with the other arguments, relnum governs the
		   relative number of regions that will be found.  relnum
		   is used as part of a test to determine whether two
		   spectral areas containing peaks are close enough together
		   to be represented as a single region.  The default value
		   for relnum is 12.  Increasing this number will decrease
		   the number of regions which are found, and decreasing this
		   number will decrease the number of regions which are found.
      threshold - A sensitivity factor used to decide if a data point is
		   large enough, relative to the noise level, to qualify
		   as part of a peak.  The default value is 0.6.  A larger
		   value will make peak selection more sensitive, and a
		   smaller number will make peak selection less sensitive.
      npoints - Governs the number of successive data points which must
		   qualify as part of a peak (see the description of
		   threshold above) for that spectral area to be considered
		   a real peak area.  The default value of this parameter is
		   function of fn, sw, weighting functions, and other things.
		   Its normal range is from 7 to 40, but may need to be
		   adjusted to a lower value for Carbon spectra with large
		   spectral windows.
      tailsize - In combination with relnum and other factors, tailsize
		   governs whether two spectral areas which contain peaks
		   are close enough together to be represented as a single
		   region.

  The number of peak regions will be returned to the caller if the
  command is suffixed with a colon and a parameter name.

  "numreg" returns the number of regions in a previously divided spectrum
  (either with "region" or by "hand" using the Z command or with the mouse
  button).  Each "region" is the area between two integral reset points,
  with every other reset point designating the start of a "baseline"
  section and not included in the count of the number of regions.
  The number of peak regions will be returned to the caller if the
  command is suffixed with a colon and a parameter name.

  "getreg" returns the highfield and lowfield frequencies in Hz of the
  specified region.  The spectrum should have been previously divided
  into regions with either the "region" command or by "hand".
  These frequencies will be returned to the caller if the command is
  suffixed with a colon one or two parameter names.
