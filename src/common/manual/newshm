newshm  -  interactively create a 'method' string for autoshimming 

	To shim after running 'newshm' type:
		method='methodname'	
	Then type 'shim' or set the 'wshim' parameter 
	to shim before the start of acquisition.
	'methodname' is the name suplied to 'newshm'.

	DESCRIPTION:

 	'newshm' is an interactive program that creates a 'method' string
	to be used in autoshimming of  the magnetic field homogeneity.
	The method string may consist of a series of shimming operations.

	This command provides for either lock shimming or FID shimming,
	permitting the user to choose whichever is best for him.
	Lock shimming is much faster, but FID shimming is frequently
	much more effective in improving the field. With FID shimming,
	the FID evaluation range limits are requested.  The full range
	is 0 to 100. Sensitivity to higher order gradients is greatly
 	increased by setting the finish limit to about 5 or 10 with
	the start limit at 0. Note that Mercury and GEMINI 2000 do not
	support FID shimming.

	It begins by asking for the name of the new shim 'method'.
	The new 'method' is found in " curexp+'/../shimmethods' ".

	'newshm' is much like 'stdshm' but is more flexible and
	provides for a shimming time and FID evaluation limits 
	supplied by the user.
	It differs from 'stdshm' primarily because that commands 
	provides for determining an estimated shimming time for 
	the selected shim controls.  When no time limit is supplied,
 	autoshim continues until the exit criteria is met, or
 	a the number of cycles reaches a limit.

	If the non-spin (transverse) controls are chosen for adjustment,
	the spinner is turned off, otherwise it is turned on.

	If uncertain about the shim criteria, the "medium to medium"
	choice is suitable in most circumstances.

	dshim('method') describes 'method' strings. The 'vi' editor
	may be used to make and modify them. 

	For further information about shimming, see Chapter 3
	of the 'Operation Manual'.
