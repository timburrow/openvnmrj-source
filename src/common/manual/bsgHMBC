bsgHMBCAD: Gradient selected phase sensitive HMBC, adiabatic version with F1 Band-Selection

See the Sel2DTab, JnCHTab, and gHMBCAD for more information.

Information Conyeyed - Long Range X/Y chemical shift correlations.

gHMCBAD is a first tier structure experiment because it will reveal for the case
of 1H and 13C all measurable couplings from each 1H to all 13Cs. The combination of
gCOSY, HSQCAD, and gHSQCAD are often all the experiments needed to complete a complex
structural assignment problem.

This is a F1-band-selected experiment. The experiment affords an excellent means to
significantly reduce experiment time required to obtain high F1 resolution for a focused
region. Use with 13C is most likely. At setup time customize in the Acquire -> Default
panel to define the desired region either interactively with cursors if a HMBC has
been acquired as a part of the study previously or just entry the desired F1 range
into the entry boxes. There is a button to create the shape and subsequent display of
pulse sequence will reflect the true selective pulse parameters.
