pen(<device>,color)	        select a pen or color for drawing
move(<device>,x,y)	        move to absolute location x and y.
draw(<device>,x,y)	        draw from current location to absolute

******************************************************************************

pen, move, and draw provide a line drawing capability on either the
graphics screen or a plotter.  The selection of either the graphics
screen or plotter is made with the device argument.  This selection
will remain active until the next device argument is passed.
The device argument may be passed to either pen, move, or draw.

pen selects the active color for the graphics screen or pen number
for a plotter.  move sets the location from which a draw will start.
draw moves to its supplied coordinates,  drawing a line as it goes.

The range of x is 0 at the left edge of the chart and wcmax at the 
right edge of the chart.  The range of y is -20 at the bottom of the
chart and wc2max at the top.  The arguments x and y are in millimeters.
The color and device options are listed below.

  device:	'graphics'            graphics screen
                'plotter'             plotter
  color:	'red','green','blue','cyan','magenta','yellow','black','white'
                'cursor','integral','threshold','scale','fid','spectrum','imaginary','parameter'
                'pen1','pen2','pen3', ...
  This list includes eight symbolic color names (cursor, integral, etc). The actual
  colors associated with the symbolic names may be set with the "Display options..."
  tool in the Edit menu. The advantage of using the symbolic names is that they
  are probably adjusted to look good with the chosen background color. For example,
  using the color white for drawing on the graphics screen may look fine with a
  dark background, but will be invisible if the background is white.  Using the
  color 'spectrum' will probably look good for both light and dark backgrounds.

 Some examples will illustrate the use of these commands.

 Draw a yellow line on the graphics screen at the "th" level.

pen('graphics','threshold')          "select graphics screen and threshold color"
move(wcmax-sc-wc,vp+th)              "move to left edge of the chart as x"
                                     "and the threshhold level as y"
draw(wcmax-sc,vp+th)                 "draw a line to the right edge of the"
                                     "chart and at the threshhold level as y"

 Draw the two cursors on the plotter using pen three.

pen('plotter','pen3')                    "select plotter and pen three"
move(wcmax-sc-wc*(cr-sp)/wp,-20)         "move to the cursor position along x"
                                         "and the bottom of the chart along y"
draw(wcmax-sc-wc*(cr-sp)/wp,wc2max)      "move to the cursor position along x"
                                         "and the top of the chart along y"
move(wcmax-sc-wc*(cr-delta-sp)/wp,-20)   "move to the delta position along x"
                                         "and the bottom of the chart along y"
draw(wcmax-sc-wc*(cr-delta-sp)/wp,wc2max)"move to the delta position along x"
                                         "and the top of the chart along y"
