*******************************************************************************
wbs	-  Specify action to take when 'bs' transients have accumulated
werr	-  Specify action to take if an error occurs
wnt	-  Specify action to take when 'nt' transients have accumulated
wexp	-  Specify action to take when the entire (acquisition) experiment
	   completes
wexp:$active - return whether macro is executed as part of "when" processing.
*******************************************************************************

These commands specify what action to take when the indicated acquisition
event occurs.  Each command requires a single argument, a string containing
the command or macro to be executed when this event happens.  Since strings
must be enclosed in single quotes, the reverse quote can be used to indicate
the single quote character.
Thus:
      wexp('ft(`all`)')
tells the system to transform all FIDs when the acquisition completes.

Each command sets the corresponding parameter value.  Using the command,
rather than setting the value explicitly, will notify the acquisition
process that the associated parameter's value has changed.  Thus by using
the command, the desired operation can be effected, even if the experiment
has already started.

If wexp is called with no arguments but with a return value, as in wexp:$active,
then it tests whether the macro that issued the wexp call is running as part of
any "when processing". It will return a 1 if it is executing from within a
"when processing" macro. It will return a 0 otherwise. For example, if
wexp='doMyProcessing' and the doMyProcessing calls wexp:$active, then when
one enters au and at the end of the acquisition, when wexp processing occurs,
wexp:$active will set $active=1.  However, if one just enters doMyProcessing
from the command line, wexp:$active will return a 0. Note that the wexp:$active
does not distinguish what kind of "when processing" is occurring. It will return
a 1 if it is called from a macro running as part of wbs, wnt, wexp, or werr
processing.
