movesw	- move spectral window according to cursors             (macro)
minsw   - reduce spectral width to the minimum required         (macro)
movetof - move transmitter offset "tof" to cursor position      (macro)
*******************************************************************************

  "movesw" uses the parameters "cr" and "delta", to calculate a new transmitter
  offset "tof" and a new spectral width "sw". If referencing was used, it is
  also adjusted. "sp" and "wp" are set to display that window.
  "movesw(width)" sets "sw" to width, rather than to a value calculated from
  "delta"

  "minsw" searches the spectrum for peaks, sets new limits accordingly, and
  then calls "movesw" to calculate a new transmitter offset "tof" and a new
  spectral width "sw".

  "movetof" will move the transmitter so that the current cursor position,
  defined by the parameter cr, will become the center of the spectrum.
  movetof(frequency) set the transmitter frequency to the passed argument,
  rather than using the cursor position to define the frequency.  This
  provides a convenient method of moving the transmitter frequency outside
  of the current spectral window.  If referencing was used, movetof will
  maintain the referencing.
