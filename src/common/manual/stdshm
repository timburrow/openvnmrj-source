stdshm   -  a command to create a 'method' string for autoshimming
		with spinning samples.

	To shim after running 'stdshm' type:
		method='std'	 [for lock shimming]  or
		method='fidstd'  [for FID shimming]
	Then type 'shim' or set the 'wshim' parameter 
	to shim before the start of acquisition.

 	This command creates a 'method' string to be used in adjusting the
	spinning controls, z1, z2, z3 and z4 when a sample is changed.
 	If non-spin controls also need adjusting, further shimming
	operations are required. 
	The 'method' string is constructed in answer to questions about 
	the sample length, the  time available for shimming, and
	the solvent T1 or, in FID shimming, the T1 of the sample.
	Note that GEMINI 2000 does not support background FID shimming,
	and therefore this option should not be selected when creating
	a shim method for GEMINI 2000.

        In asking about sample height, the macro assumes 
	that  z3 and z4 need adjusting only with short samples,
	therefore select 'sample height will vary' if z3 and z4
	shimming is definitely wanted.

	Try lock shimming first to see if it will 
	produce a satisfactory result because it requires a much 
	shorter shimming time, and usually it will adjust z1 and z2 
	as good as FID shimming.  If it does not, try fid shimming.
	Again , when z3 and z4 adjustment is required, lock shimming
	will be much faster, but FID shimming is much more effective.

	This command displays the estimated time for the shimming,
	permitting revision when the time is too long.

	'newshm' is much like 'stdshm' but provides more flexibility 
 	in making 'method' strings than 'stdshm'

	dshim('methodname') displays 'method' strings.

	For further information about shimming, see Chapter 3
	of the System Operation Manual.

	See also 'dshim', 'newshm'.
