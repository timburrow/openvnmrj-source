zerofillfid<(newnp<,datapath>)> - zerofill an FID
******************************************************************************
  
zerofillfid will add zeros to an FID file.

"newnp" is an optional number greater than the current value of np.
If no argument is given or if a zero is given, newnp is calculated
to be the next power of 2 larger than np.

For example, zerofillfid(np*2) will zerofill the fid, as if it was 
acquired with twice of the acquisition time (np=np*2, at=at*2). 

An optional second argument specifies the filename of an FID file.
If there is no second argument, zerofillfid will add zeros to the FID
in the current experiment.

If no second argument is given, the "current" and "processed" values
of "np" and "at" parameters will be updated.

If no second argument is given, this command will overwrite acqfil/fid
and acqfil/procpar in curexp.  If acqfil/fid is linked to a saved fid file,
the link will be replaced by a copy, so the original fid will not be overwritten.
 
If the fid file has multiple traces, all traces will be zerofilled.

This command can be repeated to further zerofill the fid.
