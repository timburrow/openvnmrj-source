macrold		- 	load a user macro into memory
*******************************************************************************

  The macrold command loads a macro into memory. If the
  macro already exists in memory, it gets overwritten by the new
  macro.  The same search path used when deciding which macro is
  executed is used for loading macros.  Macros may reside in various
  places, as determined by the "applications directories", or appdirs.
  Typical places include the users vnmrsys/maclib directory and
  /vnmr/maclib.  When macros are loaded, the appdirs are searched
  in order.  If an absolute path name is supplied
  as the argument to macrold, then that macro will be loaded.
  In this way, macros which are not in a maclib may be loaded and
  executed from VNMR.  The macrold command increases the speed
  of execution of these specifically loaded macros.  The tradeoff
  is that memory is used.

  A return value from macrold will be set to 1 if the load succeeded
  and it will be set to 0 if the load failed.  Requesting a return
  value from macrold will also suppress the message that the macro
  is loaded. If the macro failed to load, a message about the failure
  will be displayed. If a second return argument is requested, possible
  failure messages will also be suppressed. The suppressed messages
  will be put into the second return argument.

  All loaded macros or individual macros may be removed from memory with
  the purge command.  The mstat command will display macros which have
  been loaded into memory.

  If a macro that has already been loaded into memory is edited by
  the macrovi command, it automatically gets loaded by
  those commands.  This overwrites the previous macro.  However, if a
  macro is edited or created some other way (with macrocp perhaps),
  it is not automatically loaded.  If the macro already exists in
  memory, the previous version will execute unless the user does a
  macrold.

  Usage  -  macrold('macrofile')        load macro macrofile
            macrold('_sw'):$ret         load macro _sw and suppress any
                                        success message on line 3.
                                        $ret will be set to 1 or 0,
                                        for success or failure, respectively.
            macrold('_sw'):$ret,$msg    load macro _sw and suppress any
                                        messages on line 3.
                                        $ret will be set to 1 or 0,
                                        for success or failure, respectively.
                                        $msg will be set to the result message.
