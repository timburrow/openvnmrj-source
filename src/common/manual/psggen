SHELLSCRIPT
-----------

The UNIX shellscript PSGGEN can be run from within UNIX by simply typing
the name of the shellscript.  The course that PSGGEN takes depends on
SEQGEN_OPTION for a Sun 3 system:


	SEQGEN_OPTION = f68881  :

		PSGGEN checks to insure that the Varian PSG
		object library LIBPARAM_FPC.A is in the user
		PSG directory.  PSGGEN will create the user
		PSG object library with the name LIBPSGLIB_FPC.A.


	SEQGEN_OPTION = ffpa  :

		PSGGEN checks to insure that the Varian PSG
		object library LIBPARAM_FPA.A is in the user
		PSG directory.  [Note that LIBPARAM_FPA.A is
		not provided as standard software in the sys-
		tem PSG directory.]  PSGGEN will create the
		user PSG object library with the name
		LIBPSGLIB_FPA.A.


For a Sun 4 system, PSGGEN has no dependence on SEQGEN_OPTION and
always creates the user PSG object library with the name LIBPSGLIB.A.
PSGGEN also executes the SETUSERPSG shellscript in the system BIN
directory.  If SETUSERPSG is missing, PSGGEN returns an error and
exits.

In order for PSGGEN to function properly, the source files in the
user PSG directory must be have a later date than those in the
system PSG directory.  If this is not the case, one can "touch" the
files in the user PSG directory to overcome this problem:

		> touch filename1.c filename2.h ...


MACRO
-----

PSGGEN can also be run from within VNMR by simply executing the macro
PSGGEN.  The macro PSGGEN calls the UNIX shellscript PSGGEN.
