bashdNOESY: Band-Selected 2D NOESY with F1 decoupling 

Also see the Sel2DTab for general information

The bashdNOESY experiment is a 2D NOESY with F1 band-selection. Setup can be from
either a selexcit selective 1D or the bashdNOESY itself. Simply choose the desired F1
region. There is a very powerful and unique experimental option to decouple protons
from protons in the F1 dimension to further improve resolution.

Closely related are the bashdROESY and bashdTOCSY experiments which function in exactly
the same fashion.  This entire family can be used to great benefit with molecules such
as peptides where the alpha-CH region of the 1H spectrum is selected. There are no other
experiments that afford all of the advantages this family provides for such studies.
