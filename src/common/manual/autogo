autogo	-  start automation run
*************************************************************************

The "autogo" command starts an automation run.  This command requires
write access to the file "conpar" in the VNMR system directory.  It
cannot be entered while the spectrometer is in automation mode.

This command can accept one or two arguments.  If two are provided,
the second is interpreted as the location of the automation directory
The first argument is always the name of the "enter queue", the file
you prepared with the "enter" command.  If the command is entered with
no arguments, it will use the current value of the parameter "autodir"
as the location of the automation directory and ask for the location
of the enter queue.  You must have an enter queue prepared to start
an automation run.

The enter queue (also referred to as the automation queue) is checked to
verify it was prepared using the "enter" command and will abort if an
error in the format is found.  Your automation directory is checked for
the presence of a non-empty enter queue and the "autogo" command aborts
if the current queue in the automation directory is present and not
empty.

The "autogo" command checks the automation directory and will use the
"auto" command if it is not present or another problem is found.

When this command completes, the spectrometer is in automation mode
and your automation run starts.
