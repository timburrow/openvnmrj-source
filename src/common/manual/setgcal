To calibrate the value of the user global parameter gcal, one needs to 
acquire signal from a known sized object while the gradient is on.  
The gcenter and profile sequences do this.  The extent of the object in 
cm, the extent of the object in hz, and the gradient strength in dac#s 
are asked and the value gcal set.  gcal*gradient_value = gauss/cm.

For example, after running profile, enter ds, click on Th, enter
th=th/5, and set the box cursors where the threshhold intersects
the spectrum.  The parameter delta is the value for width of object 
in hz.  Run setgcal and enter 1.6 for the size of object in cm 
(standard Varian probe), enter the value of delta for the frequency 
spread in hz, and the value of gzlvl1 for the gradient dac value.
