      Syntax: plot

 Description: "plot" is designed as a universal plotting macro; it is normally
	      called through the "procplot" macro (which by itself serves as
	      processing / plotting facility for automatic experiments), but it
	      can as well be used directly by the user who then doesn't have to
	      remember specific plotting macros.
	      The main purpose of "plot" is, to automatically call the correct
	      specialized plotting macro, depending on either the user defini-
	      tion, or otherwise on the type of data present in the experiment.
	      A plotting macro will be selected automatically, accor-
	      ding to the following scheme:
		 APT spectra				plapt
		 other, non-arrayed 1D data		plot1d
		 DEPT type arrayed spectra		pldept
		 other arrayed 1D spectra		plarray
		 J-resolved 2D spectra			pl2dj
		 homonuclear correlation 2D spectra	plcosy
		 heteronuclear correlation 2D spectra	plhxcor
	      Other types of 2D spectra (mostly multiple quantum 2D spectra,
	      like 2D-INADEQUATE) are not plotted automatically at this point
	      in time. For phase-sensitive 2D spectra automatic plotting is
	      only provided if they were acquired using the method described
	      by States, Haberkorn, et al.; TPPI spectra are not covered.
	      Note that plot macros in general will and should NOT adjust the
	      phase, the vertical scale, or change integral size and reset
	      points; these are assumed to be adjusted either by hand, or by
	      a suitable processing macro like "procplot" and the macros that
	      are called therein. The plotting macros will only make adjustments
	      in order to make spectrum and parameters fit onto the page in the
	      desired way.

   Alternate: If the user knows their names, he/she can of course also call
	      the specialized macros directly.
