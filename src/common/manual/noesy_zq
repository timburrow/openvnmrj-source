Pulse sequence:
noesy_zq  - 2D cross relaxation experiment with solvent suppression
               by transmitter presaturation. F1 quadrature by States-TPPI.
               Gradient homospoil pulse (gt1,gzlvl1) can be used in mixing
               time. Transmitter has to be at solvent frequency!!!
               Allows single transient spectra (zfs recommended!!!).

   satmode : determines when the saturation happens. Satmode should be set
             to satmode='ynyn' to enable solvent saturation during d1 and mix.
             NO solvent saturation during t1 is recommended!!!
    satdly : length of presaturation period during relaxation delay d1.
    satpwr : saturation power ( < 50Hz; ~ 0dB)
     scuba : 'y' inserts comp(180) - scubad/2 - comp(180) - scubad/2 at the 
             end of presat to recover the alpha-protons (scubad ~ 40-60ms).
     sspul : 'y' selects gradient homospoil (gt1,gzlvl1) at beginning of d1.
    gzlvl1 : gradient level for sspul
       gt1 : gradient duration for sspul
       mix : mixing time
    gzlvl2 : homospoil gradient level during mix
       gt2 : homospoil gradient duration during mix
    zqflg  : optional flag for ZQ suppression !!!
     compH : 1H amplifier compression factor
                  The shaped pulses and gradient powers are
                  calculated on-the-fly.
                (needs a probe file with proper calibration data !!!)
   alt_grd : alternate gradient sign(s) in ZQ-filter on even transients
 The parameters: gcal_local, coil_size and h1freq_local necessary
 for ZQ suppression are taken from the probe file by the setup macro or
 calculated automatically.
 The parameter swfactor controling the width of the frequency range to be
 refocused for the ZQ filter is defaulted to 9.0 in the pulse sequence (as
 recommended by the literature reference).
 On the other hand, for very wide spectral windows the inversion range is
 limited to 60 kHZ to prevent dangerously high gradient levels to be set.
