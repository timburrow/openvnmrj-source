 cdept - Automated carbon and DEPT acquisition (M)
*******************************************************************************

      Syntax: cdept<(solvent)>

 Description: prepares parameters for automatically acquiring a standard
              C13 spectrum, followed by a dept experiment. In non-automation
	      mode,  the carbon and dept spectra will be acquired in the
	      experiment in which the cdept command was typed.  Following
	      the completion of the acquisition,  the commands rttmp('C13')
	      and rttmp('dept') may be used for further processing of the
	      carbon and dept spectra, respectively. 
  	      An optional solvent argument may be supplied. In automation
	      mode,  this is supplied by the enter program. In non-automation
	      mode, the default is cdcl3.

   Arguments: solvent is the name of the solvent used. In automation mode,
	        this is supplied by the enter program. In non-automation
                mode, the default is 'cdcl3'.

    Examples: cdept au
	      cdept('DMSO') nt=10000 au
