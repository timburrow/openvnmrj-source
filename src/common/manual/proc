*************************************************

proc, proc1, and proc2 specify the type of data processing to be
performed upon the "np" (t2) FID, the "ni" (t1) interferogram,
and the "ni2" interferogram, respectively.  Three types of data
processing are currently supported:


	 ft   -   complex Fourier transform
	rft   -   real Fourier transform
	 lp   -   LP processing on complex data


All Varian data must be processed along "np" with a complex FT.
Sequentially sampled Bruker data (the usual case) must be proces-
sed along this dimension with a real FT; simultaneously sampled
Bruker data, with a complex FT.

All pure absorptive 2D data collected by the States-Haberkorn
(Hypercomplex) method must be processed along "ni" or "ni2" with a
complex FT.  Similar data collected by the TPPI method on a Varian
spectrometer can be processed in one of two ways, depending upon
how the data was collected:


	 phase = 3:       complex FT	proc1 = 'ft'	(standard way)
	 phase = 1,4:     real FT     	proc1 = 'ft'	(new way)

	phase2 = 3:       complex FT	proc2 = 'ft'
	phase2 = 1,4:     real FT     	proc2 = 'ft'


Pure absorptive 2D data collected by the TPPI method on a Bruker
spectrometer must be processed along "ni" (t1) with a real FT, i.e.,
proc1 = 'rft'.

If the 'lp' processing option is selected, additional parameters
must be set to fully define how the time-domain data is to be
processed.  These parameters are described in the manual entry "lp".
