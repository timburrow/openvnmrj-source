bsHSQCROESY: F1- Band-Selected ROESY with 1H-1H ROE dispersed at 13 C chemical shift,
             adiabatic version

See the Sel2DTab for general information. Closely related is the bsHSQCNOESY experiment. 

This ROESY version is provided to deal with molecules that are of a size where NOE
effects are vanishingly small.

This experiment is a often a third tier experiment meaning there is no easy means to
obtain the 1H-1H NOE by other methods such as ROESY or ROESY1D. Similar to stepNOESY in
this regard. Basically this is a HSQC with the addition of a ROESY mixing time (mixR).

This pulse sequence utilizes fully adiabatic 13C 180s that are designed to
time refocusing to best match the likely 1JCH coupling for a given 13C chemical
shift. Generally speaking 1JCH is smallest at low values for 13C chemical shifts and
increases in value as carbon shift increases. These specially timed adiabatic pulses
improve signal to noise, decrease loss of signal because of minor calibration defects
and generally yield data with fairly good quantification potential. Because of the
special nature of the timed sweep inversion afforded by the adiabatic pulses it is best
to retain the default value of 146 for the parameter j1xh. Cyclo-propyl groups are an
expection that will suffer from phase distortion because the 13C chemical shift is at
very high-field yet the 1JCH coupling is very large.

All adiabatic pulses are created and parameters loaded into the experiment at setup
time using the calibrations found on the probe file.

This is a F1-band-selected experiment. At setup time customize in the Acquire -> Default
panel to define the desired region either interactively with cursors if a HSQC has
been acquired as a part of the study previously or just entry the desired F1 range
into the entry boxes. There is a button to create the shape and subsequent display of
pulse sequence will reflect the true selective pulse parameters.
