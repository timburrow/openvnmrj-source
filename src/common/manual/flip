flip<(options)>	- 	flip graphics and text window
******************************************************************************

  Windows on the computer screen often overlap, with some windows on
  top or in front of other windows.  The flip can be used to bring the Vnmr
  text window or graphics window to the top of the screen. It can also
  control under what circumstances the windows will flip.  The standard
  X-window function of clicking on the window border will always bring
  that window to the front.  The Sun keyboard Front key will bring the
  window in which the mouse arrow is placed to the front.

  The flip command will alternately bring the text and graphics
  windows to the front.  This is the command that is called from the
  Flip button in the main menu.
  flip('text') brings the text window to the front.
  flip('graphics') brings the graphics window to the front.

  Commands which write to or draw in these windows also bring the
  corresponding window to the front. Certain interactive programs
  such as df, ds, dg, are reactivated when parameters are set.
  These parameter changes can automatically bring the window to the
  front even though the command was not explicitly entered. For example,
  entering ds will bring the graphics to the front.  flip('text') will
  bring the text window to the front.  cr=1000 will bring the graphics
  window back to the front.  flip can alter this behavior.

  flip('text','off') specifies that neither commands which write to
  the text window nor parameter changes will bring the text window
  to the front.  The flip or flip('text') will bring the text window
  to the front.
  flip('text','on') resets the previous text window behavior.
  flip('graphics','off') and flip('graphics','on') provide equivalent
  controls for the graphics window.

  flip('text','autooff') specifies that parameter changes will not bring
  the text window to the front.  Specific commands which write to the
  text window, such as dg, dg1, etc and the flip or flip('text') will
  bring the text window to the front.
  flip('text','autoon') resets the previous behavior.
  flip('graphics','autooff') and flip('graphics','autoon') provide equivalent
  controls for the graphics window.
