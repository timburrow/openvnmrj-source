jpublish	Macro to archive and/or copy to system a local protocol (M)

Description:	Assembles all elements of the experiment protocol in the current
	experiment into a archive protocolname_proto.tar.Z into a
        User_Protocols directory of the local vnmrsys directory. If the
        user is the VnmrJ admin, the protocol is installed into the
        VnmrJ system for all users.  Note that the file protocolListWalkup.xml
        in /vnmr/adm/users would need to be edited to add the new protocol
        to the experiment chooser in a walkup-style account.  The user is
        prompted for all needed information and the addition of one
        additional setup support macro is allowed. By default, jpublish
        will assign the local protocol name and seqfil as being associated.
        This is almost always the case.

Applicability:	Liquids NMR.
