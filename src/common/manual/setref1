      Syntax: setref1(nucleus)
	      setref2(nucleus)

 Description: These macros do the same thing as "setref", but for f1 and f2 in
	      2D and 3D experiments, i.e., they ESTIMATE the f1 and f2
	      referencing based on the same method as "setref", i.e., based on
	      an estimated chemical shift value for the lock signal. At least,
	      if you use "setref" AND "setref1" (AND "setref2" for 3D), all
	      dimensions are consistently referenced based on the same
	      estimated chemical 2H shift.
	      If you have manually (re-)referenced the observe dimension (e.g.,
	      by setting the reference to an actual reference signal such as
	      TMS), then you should better use "reff1" (and "reff2" for 3D)
	      to reference the indirect dimensions based on the referencing
	      in the observe dimension.
              If a global (or local) flag "bioref" exists and is set to 'y',
              bio-NMR referencing (based on "nuctables/nuctabrefBio") is used
              rather than standard IUPAC / organic chemistry referencing
              (based on "nuctables/nuctabref").

    Examples: setref1(tn)
	      setref2('C13')
