PARAMETERS

  sspul     : grad-90-grad steady-state flag
  hsgt      : gradient duration for sspul (2 msec)
  hsglvl    : gradient power for sspul (15-20 G/cm)
  pw        : 90 deg. proton pulse
  tpwr      : power level for pw
  pwx       : 90 deg. X pulse
  pwxlvl    : power level for pwx
  mix       : mixing time
  gt1       : gradient duration for dephasing (C13)
  gzlvl1    : gradient power for dephasing (~2-3G/cm)
  gt2       : gradient duration for homospoil during mix
  gzlvl2    : gradient power for homospoil during mix
  gt3       : gradient duration for rephasing (H1) 
  gzlvl3    : gradient power for rephasing (~-2-3G/cm)
  gstab     : gradient stabilization delay
  grad_sel  : 'y' pulse sequence with gradient selection
                      'n' pulse sequence with NO gradiebnt selection

NOTE: This experiment with gradient coherence patway selection may
      provide better cancellation efficiency BUT may result in
      unacceptable signal losses due to diffusion and possible 
      convection. Do not use long mixing times and strong (more then 2G/cm)
      gzlvl1 and gzlvl3 gradients if grad_sel is set to 'y'.

      The sequence uses a dec. 180 deg. pulse in the middle of the
      evolution period to do F1 decoupling. F2 decoupling during
      during acquisition is optional via dm='nny' but please consider
      that the XMTR and te DCPLR shares the same amplifier band therefore
      the receiver and the decoupler is time shared during acquisition -
      this causes sensitivity losses (60% by default).

PROCESSING

  f1coef='1 0 1 0 0 -1 0 1' for grad_sel='y'
  f1coef=''                 for grad_sel='n'
