 p31 - Automated Phosphorus Acquisition  (M)
*******************************************************************************

      Syntax: p31<(solvent)>

 Description: prepares parameters for automatically acquiring a standard
	        P31 spectrum.  wexp is set to procplot for standard
                processing. If p31 is used as the command for automation
                via the enter command, then the au is supplied automatically
                and should not be entered on the MACRO line of the enter
                program.  However, it is possible to customize the standard
                p31 macro on the MACRO line by following it with additional
                commands and parameters.  For example, p31 nt=1 will use the
                standard p31 setup but with only one transient.

   Arguments: solvent - the name of the solvent (default: CDCl3); in automation
		mode the solvent is supplied by the enter program.

    Examples: p31 au
	      p31('DMSO') ernst(5) au
	      p31('Acetone') d1=5 pw(90) au
