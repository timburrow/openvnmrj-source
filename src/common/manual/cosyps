PW = 90 degree pulse.
P1 = 90 degree pulse if PHASE <> 0; if PHASE = 0, pulses greater than 90
     degrees will de-emphasize diagonal peaks for P-type peak selection
D1 = set to 1-3*T1
D2 = evolution time (t1 period)
AT = acquisition time (t2 period)
SW = spectral width (usually SW1 = SW, except for PHASE = 3)
NI = number of t1 increments (set so that SW1/NI = 12);  may be
     be decreased if speed is essential
SS = number of steady-state transients;  if ss < 0, then -ss
     transients (with phasecycling of pulses and receiver) are
     performed before EACH experiment in either an arrayed or 2D
     experiment; if ss > 0, then ss transients are performed before
     only the first experiment in such cases.

PRESAT = decoupler presaturation period using a decoupler power
         specified by DHP or DPWR; does not depend on DM but does
	 depend on DMM; activated as a part of D1 if PRESAT > 0.
         (PRESAT option is not available on Mercury and GEMINI 2000.)

PHASE = 1,2  (suggested value) for phase-sensitive data

NOTE:  For PHASE = 3, remember that sw1 = 2*sw (for homonuclear
       experiments) or that sw1 must be set to TWICE the desired
       value (for heteronuclear experiments).

NT = multiple of 8 (PHASE = 0)  (minimum)
     multiple of 4 (PHASE = 1,2 or 3)  (minimum)


When data processing, phase the first increment in t1 to be pure
absorptive and then add 90 degrees to RP.  Set RP1 = 90 and LP1 = 0
initially.  If the F1 phasing is not satisfactory, adjust RP1 and
LP1 so that the diagonal peaks are pure absorptive and then add
90 degrees to RP1.


v1  = phasecycle for first pulse
v2  = phasecycle for second pulse
oph = phasecycle for receiver

v1  =  x -x  y -y  y -y  x -x

v2  =  x  x  y  y  y  y  x  x

oph =  x -x  y -y  y -y  x -x


These phases are for PHASE = 1.  For PHASE = 2, add 90 degrees
to v1.  For PHASE = 3, add 90*(ix - 1) degrees to v1 where ix
is the increment counter.  For PHASE = 0, the subcycle for P-type
peak selection is mixed into v2.

PHASE =   0:  2D data for AV display (P-type peaks)
PHASE = 1,2:  2D hypercomplex data (States-Haberkorn method)
PHASE =   3:  2D TPPI data
