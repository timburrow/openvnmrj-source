  PW = 90 degree pulse.
  P1 = 90 degree pulse if RELAY <> 0; if RELAY = 0, pulses greater than 90
       degrees will de-emphasize diagonal peaks for P-type peak selection
       and pulse less than 90 degrees, for N-type peak selection
  D1 = set to 1-3*T1
  D2 = evolution time (t1 period)
  AT = acquisition time (t2 period)
  SW = spectral width (SW1 = SW)
  NI = number of t1 increments (set so that SW1/NI = 6);  may be
       be decreased if speed is essential

  TAU = propagation time for long-range cosy (RELAY = 0) and for relayed
        COSY (RELAY > 0)
RELAY = number of relays to be performed; if RELAY = 0, a normal absolute
        value COSY is performed; if RELAY = 1, a RELAY-COSY is performed;
        if RELAY = 2, a DOUBLE-RELAY-COSY is performed.
