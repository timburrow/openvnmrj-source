Augmap_1 - Augmap_6: 	Automated Gradient map generation macros (M)

        syntex:         Augmap_n where n is a number from 1 to 6
        Description:    Used by Aumakegmap auto gradient map generation
        		routine.   Applicable only for lk gradient map. 
        		Automatically adjust gradient level, offset, window
        		and pulse width to generate z1-z4 gradient map
        		using 2Hz D2O sample.   To include higher order
        		z gradients, edit the Augmap_3 macro to set gzsize
        		to the appropriate value.
