  Description:
  ------------
  "enter" allows entry of sample information for automation runs.
  If the file name parameter is not supplied, you are prompted for this
  information.  If the file already exists, new entries will be appended
  to it. The enter program allows you to input the sample location,
  user information, which solvent is used, which experiment or experiments
  to run, and arbitrary text information.  For each sample, use the
  "Add Entry" button to temporarily save that information.  You can then
  add information for another sample and use "Add Entry" to also
  temporarily save that additional information.  This information is not
  saved to the filename file until you click on the "Exit and Save" button.
  Alternatively, clicking the "Quit" button will cancel your session
  and the temporary information will not be added to the filename file.

  If enter is started from Vnmr while an automation run is active, and
  if a filename is not supplied as an argument, the the enter program
  will submit experiments directly to the automation run.  In this case,
  after selecting the experimental conditions, you are presented with the
  choices "Add Sample", "Priority Sample", and "Quit".  The "Add Sample"
  button adds the experiment to the automation run.  The "Priority Sample"
  button adds the experiment to the automation run such that it will be
  the next experiment executed.  After either the "Add Sample" and "Priority 
  Sample" buttons are pressed, the enter program exits. Pressing the
  "Quit" terminates the enter program without added samples to the
  automation run.

  The exact behavior of the enter command is configurable.  An optional
  second argument to enter may be used to specify a custom configuration file.
  See the discussion in the "Sample Changer Operation" in the System
  Operation manual and the "Customizing the enter interface" chapter
  in the User Programming manual.

  Example:
  ---------
	enter('mysamples')
