 proc1d - Processing macro for simple (non-arrayed) 1D spectra (M)
*****************************************************************************

      Syntax: proc1d

 Description: "proc1d" is a "generic" macro for processing non-arrayed 1D
	      spectra using a set of standard macros. proc1d is called by the
	      "procplot" macro, but can also be used "by hand".
	      "proc1d" first tries to find a macro with the name of the observe
	      nucleus (in lower case) + 'p' (e.g.: h1p, c13p). If such a macro
	      exists, it is called. If such a nucleus-specific macro is not
	      found in the command path, a "minimal" 1D processing is performed
	      (the idea is, to provide a well processed spectrum in most cases):
	      Fourier transformation (using pre-set weighting functions), auto-
	      matic phasing (aphx macro), automatic integration (integrate
	      macro), vertical scale adjustment (vsadj macro), avoiding exces-
	      sive noise (noislm macro), and threshold adjustment ("thadj"
	      macro). "proc1d" does not deal with arrayed 1D spectra: use
	      either "deptproc" (for dept type spectra) or "procarray" (for
	      all other arrayed 1D data).
