The Common Tab Family

This experiment selector tab is a convenient listing of very commonly used and key
small molecule liquids experiments.  These experiments are by default:

PROTON - sets parameters to acquire a 1H NMR 1D dataset using the s2pul sequence. In
the std1D apptype family.

CARBON - sets parameters to acquire a 13C NMR 1D dataset using the s2pul sequence. In
the std1D apptype family.

(H)PRESAT - sets parameters for solvent-suppression via presaturation. Many options
and in the lstd1D apptype which will force user customization at setup time.

(H)wet1D - sets parameters for solvent-suppression via the wet experiment. Many options
and in the lstd1D apptype which will force user customization at setup time.

(HH) gCOSY - converts parameters to acquire a 1H 2D gradient COSY. In the homo2D
apptype family.

(HC)HSQCAD - converts parameters to acquire a H/C 2D adiabatic HSQC. Direct H/C chemical
shift correlation. In the hetero2D apptype fammily.

(HC)gHMBCAD - converts parameters to acquire a H/C 2D adiabatic HMBC. Long-range Direct
H/C chemical shift correlation. In the hetero2D apptype fammily.

(H)NOESY1D - converts parameters to acquire a 1D NOESY. In the lstd1D apptype family.
