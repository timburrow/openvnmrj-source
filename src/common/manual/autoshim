autoshim - shim based an the method parameter

The method parameter selects shimming methods. These methods can reside in shimmethods
or proshimmethods subdirectories of applications directories. The distinction is that
methods in the shimmethods directory are executed by the NMR console either as part of
a data acquisition, started with the go, ga, or au commands or by the specific shim command.
Only methods that use the lock system can be used by methods in the shimmethods subdirectory.

Methods in the proshimmethods directory are executed on the host computer, although the
measure used to optimize the shims is obtained either from the NMR console lock system
or by running a data acquisition and analyzing the data on the host computer. These methods
can use either lock or FID/spectral information for optimization. This optimization is part
of the standard "pre-scan" mechanism used for all data acquisitions.

The autoshim determines which type of shim method is selected and calls the appropriate
mechanism to start the shimming process.
