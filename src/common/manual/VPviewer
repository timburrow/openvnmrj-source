VPviewer - tool to view and re-process VeriPulse results.

VPviewer provides an interface to access VeriPulse data. If running
VPviewer gives an error "No VeriPulse results found", it is generally
sufficient to start the VeriPulse interface from the Tools menu and
then hit the Close button.  The VeriPulse appdir must be enabled
in order to use this feature.

VPviewer expects to find the VeriPulse data sets in the directory
specified by the IPdatadir parameter. It is generally ~/vnmrsys/data.
Calling VPviewer as in
  VPviewer('show','alternate_directory')
will use the directory specified by the second argument.

The VeriPulse data directory may have more than one sets of VeriPulse
data. The top menu in the VPviewer interface has a menu to select one
of them. After selecting a data directory, one can either view a
specific test run from different studies (Select Tests radio button)
or one can view all the tests run from a specific study (Select Studies
radio button.) A pair of menus labelled "Test name:" and "Study" or
"Study name:" and "Test", respectively, allow you to select data sets.
Once selected, one would typically click the "Load" button to view that
data set. Once a data set is loaded, the Study Queue can be used to 
access all the other data sets that were collected as part of that
specific test.

The other buttons provide tools to reprocess, resave, and show
plotted results. The "History" button will show a History of the test
results.
