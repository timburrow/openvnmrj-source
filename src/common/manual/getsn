 getsn - Get signal-to-noise estimate of a spectrum (M)
*******************************************************************************

      Syntax: getsn:current_sn,predicted_sn

 Description: Estimates the noise level by measuring four adjacent 5% portions
	      at the left edge of the spectrum, finding the r.m.s. noise, and
	      taking the smallest from the four values. The fact that r.m.s.
	      instead of peak noise is measured, and the fact that four diffe-
	      rent values are evaluated should make the result reliable even
	      in the presence of several signals within the selected regions.
	      "getsn" then estimates the signal level using the vertical scale
	      adjustment macros: "vsadjh" for proton, "vsadjc" for carbon, and
	      "vsadj" for other nuclei. For carbon spectra this algorithm will
	      ignore both solvent lines and TMS; for proton spectra, in addition
	      to that the largest line in the spectrum will be ignored, if it
	      is more than three times higher than the second tallest line, and
	      the second highest line will be used instead. For other nuclei,
	      the tallest line in the spectrum is used. Finally, "getsn" esti-
	      mates the signal-to-noise at the end of the experiment by a simple
	      extrapolation (multiplying by the square root of nt/ct).

   Arguments: "current_sn" is the current signal-to-noise level.
	      "predicted_sn" is the predicted signal-to-noise level at the end
		of the experiment.
