Dosy2DTab - Diffusion-ordered 2D experiment Family.

Information Conveyed - Both relative and absolute (after calibration via the
Doneshot_nugmap setup).  It is important to see the entire DOSY manual to gain insight
into the depth of this family.

All experiments in this tab basically produce 2D data where the F2 dimension is the
detected nucleus and F1 is the diffusion rate.  As such it has the potential to separate
mixtures of compounds by their relative sizes.
