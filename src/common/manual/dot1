dot1	Setup a T1 Experiment

Format:	dot1<(min. T1 expected, max. T1 expected, total time (hours))>

	dot1 sets up all parameters to perform a T1 experiment, including d1,
	pw, p1, nt, and an array of d2 values, based on information input by
	the user.  Three arguments may be input, which are the minimum expected
	T1, the maximum expected T1, and the total time the experiment should
	take (in hours).  If no arguments are provided, dot1 will ask the user
	for the information.

Examples: dot1
          dot1(1,2,.5)
