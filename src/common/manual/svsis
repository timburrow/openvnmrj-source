******************************************************************************
svsis 		Generate and Save images as FDF files. 	(macro)
******************************************************************************

Applicability:	Systems with Imaging Module.

Format: svsis('directory_name'[,'outfmt'])

Description:	
	The "svsis" command generates images from the current experiment 
	and saves them into the specified directory as Flexible Data 
	Format (fdf) files.  It will save one image or a number of images
	in the case of multislice experiments. 

	Currently the specified directory is made in the user's data 
	directory, and will be appended with a ".dat".  Image files will 
	be created under this directory as "image0001.fdf", "image0002.fdf", 
	and so on.  A "procpar" file will also be saved into this directory.

	The 'outfmt' parameter is an optional character which defines the
	type of image data.  It can take two character values:
	'f' - Outputs the data in floating point format.  
	'm' - Outputs the data in 12 bit integer values in 16 bit words.
	The default is 'f' (floating point) and currently ImageBrowser
	only accepts floating point data.
	
	The macro only saves images from the standard SISCO imaging 
	sequences: "image", "shorte", "stecho", "multiecho", "csi2D", 
	and "ssfp".  However, it can be easily modified to produce images
	from users own sequences provided the sequences use standard 
	SISCO parameters, slice select pulse shapes, and generate data in 
	the same manner as the standard SISCO sequences.

	To easily modify the macro to use a user's sequence the user need 
	only add a line similar to the following in the "Valid Sequences"
	section:

	$k=$k+1 $seqfil[$k]='t1image'    $seq[$k]='ncsnn'  $thk[$k]='image'

	The new sequence name is 't1image'.  Its reconstruction properties
	are given by $seq whose values are similar to the parameter "seqcon".
	"seqcon"'s characters are defined as follows:
        	First character:        multiecho looping
        	Second charcter:        multislice looping
        	Third charcter:         2D phase encode loop
        	Fourth character:       3D phase encode loop
        	Fifth character:        4D phase encode loop
	The values of each character are: 
		'n':	null loop
		's':	standard loop
		'c':	compressed loop
	In this case 'ncsnn' is a standard 2D image with compressed 
	multislice. The $thk value is the slice thickness type defined by
	the type of acquisition which in this case is the standard 'image'
	sequence.

	More detailed modifications can be made to the macro but it is
	left to the user to make these adjustments.

	The macro uses a Vnmr command "svsdfd" to dump the transformed
	data out to the data file. After dumping the headers out a unix
	shell command "fdfgluer" is called to glue the headers to the
	data.  The "svsdfd" command dumps the data in such a way that the 
	(0,0) coordinates are the first data point in the file.


	NOTE: Modifications to the macro should be made in the user's
	      maclib.
