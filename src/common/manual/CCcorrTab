The (CC)corrTab Family

Information conveyed - 13C-13C connectivity

There are three experiments in the (CC)corr tab; INADEQUATE, INADEQUATEAD, and
ADEQUATEAD. The first two are 13C-detected and the ADEQUATEAD is 1H-detected.

The most efficient setup in terms of experiment time for the 2 13C-detected experiments
is to set sw1=sw and allow the double quantum frequencies to fold in F1 as they
can only fold a single time and results will be be ambigious. A rule of thumb way to
determine experiment time in the 13C-detected experiments is as follows:  Adjust ni so
that the acquisition time in F1 is about 0.01 sec.  Less resolution is needed if there
are not many carbons close togther which may be attached to one another. This is why
setting sw1=sw immediately saves a factor of two in experiment time. The next part is to
determine how many scans will be needed. If the number of scans with a simple 1D CARBON
experiment acquired with a 450 degree tip can be determined to get a signal to noise
of ~100/1 the full 2D should be of high enough quality to assign by simple inspection.

Because the ADEQUATEAD is 1H-detected the native sensitivity is higher. With a 400 MHz
One NMR probe a sample with a concentration of about 150 mM should run OK in a 16 to
24 hour time period. Of course this depends upon the specific nature of the sample.

Careful pulse width calibrations are imperitive for all of these experiments. This
task is simplified for the 13-detected experiments because in all cases enough sample
is typically used that pulse calibrations are easy on the actual sample.
