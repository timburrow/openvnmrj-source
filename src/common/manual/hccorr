 hccorr - Automated proton, carbon and HETCOR acquisition (M)
*****************************************************************************

      Syntax: hccorr<(solvent)>

 Description: Combines the operation of the h1 and c13 macros and the HETCOR
	      experiment. In non-automation mode, all spectra will be acquired
	      in the experiment in which the hccorr macro was typed. After
	      the completion of the acquisition, the command rttmp can be used
	      for further processing of the three spectra. 

   Arguments: solvent is the name of the solvent. In automation mode, the enter
	      program supplies the value. In non-automation mode, the default
	      is 'cdcl3'.

    Examples: hccorr('dmso') au
