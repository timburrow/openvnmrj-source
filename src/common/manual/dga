/****************************************************************************/

dga  	is used to display the file of spin simulation parameters (Group A).
 	There is one such group of parameters in the data system,  not one 
	per experiment as with the normal NMR parameters.

dla	displays the parameters containing the line assignments for spin 
	simulation iteration (matching simulated spectra to actual data).
        A 'clindex' value of a calculated transition gives the index
	of the assigned measured line. The value is zero for unassigned
	transitions. 

dlalong or
dla('long')	puts line assignments into the file 'spini.la' in a more
		complete form; and then displays this file in the text
		window. It is most useful when the 'dla' display is too
		large to display all the calculated transitions in the vnmr
		text window.

dlalong('returnla') returns line assignments existing before last execution
                    of the spins('iterate') command.  The line assignments
                    are returned from 'spini.savela' in the current experiment.
                    This is used by the undospins macro.
