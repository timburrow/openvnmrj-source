diffparams - report differences between two parameter sets (UNIX)

 Syntax: diffparams <-list> <-active> <-protection> file1 file2 <macroname>

 Description: reports differences between VNMR parameter sets.
              A macro can optionally be created which will convert
              file1 into file2.

Arguments: file1 and file2 are VNMR parameter files, like
                     $HOME/vnmrsys/exp1/procpar
                     $HOME/vnmrsys/exp1/curpar
                     $HOME/vnmrsys/global
                     /vnmr/conpar
                     xyz.fid/procpar
	file1 and file2 can also be directories (xyz.fid or xyz.par,
	or a local experiment like ~/vnmrsys/exp1); in this case
	diffparams will look for a subfile procpar in these directories.

        The optional -list argument will cause a list of the parameters which
        are different to be printed.  If the -list option is used, the macro
        feature is turned off.  If a parameter exists in file1 but not file2,
        it is not listed.  If a parameter exists in file2 but not file1, it
        is listed.  If the parameter exists in both files, it is listed if the
        values are different.  It is not listed if other information associated
        with the parameter is different.  This other information is things like
        protection bits, maximum values, group, type, etc.

        The optional -active argument will cause a list of the parameters, which
        have different values of the active/inactive flag, to be printed. If the
        -active option is used, the macro feature is turned off. A parameter
        must exist in both file1 and file2 and have different values of the
        active/inactive flag in order to be listed.

        The optional -protection argument will cause a list of the parameters, which
        have different values of the protection bits to be printed. If the
        -protection option is used, the macro feature is turned off. A parameter
        must exist in both file1 and file2 and have different values of the
        protection bits in order to be listed.

        The -list argument can be used by itself or with either the -active or
        -protection arguments. The -active and -protection arguments may not
        be used together.  Their order does not matter but they must precede
        file1 and file2.

        An optional argument following the two file names specifies the pathname
        of a macro to output.  This macro will contain the Magical commands
        necessary to convert file1 into file2.

        Without the -list, -active, -protection, or macro options, diffparams
        will display the list of differences between the parameters in the two files. 

    Examples: diffparams abc.fid xyz.fid
              diffparams -list abc.fid xyz.fid
              diffparams -active abc.fid xyz.fid
              diffparams -active -list abc.fid xyz.fid
              diffparams -protection -list abc.fid xyz.fid
	      diffparams ~/vnmrsys/exp1  ~/vnmrsys/exp3
	      diffparams ~/vnmrsys/exp1  ~/vnmrsys/exp3 ~/vnmrsys/maclib/change1to3
