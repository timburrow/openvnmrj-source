fitspec<('option')>	-	spectrum deconvolution
*******************************************************************************

  Fit lorentzian and/or gaussian curves to experimental data. "fitspec"
  uses input from a text file "fitspec.inpar", which describes the
  starting values for a number of lines, which should be fitted to an
  experimental spectrum, and creates an output file "fitspec.outpar",
  which contains the fitted values for these lines. Furthermore,
  the resulting line frequencies are also stored in the parameter
  "slfreq", and the resulting amplitudes in "sla".

  The files "fitspec.inpar" and "fitspec.outpar" contain the following
  information for each line:

    frequency    intensity     line width     gaussian fraction

  A * after any of the numbers indicates, that that parameter should
  not be fitted.

  The command "fitspec" in VNMR actually prepares a file "fitspec.indata",
  which contains the spectral data (as a text file), to which the data
  should be fit, and then executes the external program "fitspec",
  which is stored in "/vnmr/bin". This program uses as an input the
  files "fitspec.inpar" and "fitspec.indata", and produces after
  completion the output file "fitspec.outpar". This file is is then
  read by VNMR and uses to set "slfreq" and "sla".

fitspec('usell')

  The file "fitspec.inpar" can be prepared from a line listing
  automatically with the command "fitspec('usell')". This option
  of "fitspec" uses the information from the last line listing
  (stored in "llfrq" and "llamp"), and the parameters "slw",
  "vs", "rfl" and "rfp" to prepare that file. All lines are set
  to the same line width "slw" and the gaussian fraction is set
  to 0. If other starting values are required, this file should
  be edited.

fitspec('setslfreq')

  If the output data from a spectrum deconvolution has to be used
  in a spin simulation, this can be done automatically, if first
  the spin system is defined and then the deconvolution is done,
  because fitspec saves it's results in "slfreq" and "slamp",
  which serve as input for the iterative spin simulation.
  If the spin system is defined after the deconvolution is
  complete, the contents of "slfreq" and "sla" is lost, but the
  result of the deconvolution is still available in "fitspec.outpar".
  In this case, the option "fitspec('setslfreq')" just copies the
  information from "fitspec.outpar" back into "slfreq" and "sla".
