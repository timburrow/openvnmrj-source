 hregions - Select integral regions in proton spectrum (M)
*******************************************************************************

      Syntax: hregions

 Description: One of the most critical steps in the automatic processing of
	      proton spectra is the adjustment of the integral regions. It is
	      critical not only because of aesthetic reasons (some people like
	      many small integrals, others prefer few large regions), but also
	      (and mainly) because other commands (like "bc") totally depend on
	      the integration being correct: "bc" can either fail, or it can
	      make broad, unintegrated lines disappear from the spectrum.
	      Note that hregions was specifically designed for pro-
	      ton spectra and should not be used for other types of spectra.
              The result of hregions also depends on the lineshape and the
	      signal-to-noise ratio of a spectrum
