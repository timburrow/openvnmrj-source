*******************************************************************************

  record is a tool to record keyboard entries.  The keyboard entries are
  stored as a Magical macro in the users maclib.  If no argument is
  given, the user will be prompted for a macro name.  If the macro
  already exists, the user will be asked if it should be deleted.
  Function keys can be included in the list of Magical commands by
  entering F1 to F8 for function keys 1 to 8, respectively.  The
  record session is finished by entering off or record('off').
  While the record macro is active, the command line prompt will
  be "Command? ".
