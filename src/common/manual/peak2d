peak2d:$maximum,$trace,$point -	return information about maximum in 2D data
*******************************************************************************

  "peak2d" searches the area defined by "sp","wp","sp1" and "wp1" in a
2D data set for a maximum. It returns the maximum intensity found in the
first return variable. If a second return variable is defined, it returns
the trace number in that variable. The variable "trace" defines, whether
"f1" or "f2" traces are counted. If a third return variable is defined,
it returns the data point number of the maximum on that trace.
