*************************************************************************

These two commands allow weighting parameters to be set interactively
for both t2 FID's and t1 interferograms.  The optional argument "fidnum"
specifies which FID element or interferogram trace is to be used in
adjusting the weighting parameters.  The default value is the currently
active element or trace.  These commands respond appropriately to "phfid"
and "lsfid" for t2 FID's and to "phfid1" and "lsfid1" for t1 interfero-
grams.


Parameters:

  lb, lb1	line broadening factor in Hz; a positive value gives
		sensitivity enhancement; a negative value gives reso-
		lution enhancement.

  sb, sb1	sine bell time period in sec; a negative value give a
		sine squared bell.

  sbs, sbs1	sine bell shift in sec; shifts the origin of the sine
		bell; active only if sb (or sb1) is active.

  gf, gf1	gaussian apodization constant in sec.

  gfs, gfs1	gaussian function shift in sec; shifts the origin of
		the gaussian function; active only if gf (or gf1) is
		active.

  sa      	Sampling window in data points. Range is 8 to np/2.
                All points in the FID greater than sa will be set
                to zero. The FID points start from point 1 at the
                beginning of the FID and np/2 at the end of the FID.

  sas      	Sampling window shift in data points.  All points in
                the FID less than or equal to sas will be set to zero.
                The FID points start from point 1 at the beginning of
                the FID and np/2 at the end of the FID.  The minimum
                value of sas is 0. The maximum value is np/2 - sa.

  awc, awc1	additive weighting constant; it is added in to the
		weighting function after the lb and sb (sbs) contri-
		butions but before the gf (gfs) contributions.


These parameters can be typed in or changed with the left mouse button in
the weighting function field. "vs" and "vf" can be changed with the center
button in the proper field. The right mouse button allows to turn off the
spectrum for a faster response to changes in the weighting function.
