Based upon the current rof2 and lp values, crof2
calculates a new value for rof2 so that lp will be
rendered approximately 0.  In order for crof2 to work
properly, a trial spectrum must be obtained and phased
to pure absorption.  It is this spectrum that provides
the current rof2 and lp values for crof2.  The value
of alfa is left constant, provided rof2 does not become
less than 1 usec.  An optional argument can be used to
specify an alfa value.


NOTE:  This pertains to processing 2D data.  Unless "lp"
       is approximately 0, FPMULT will affect both the
       DC offset and the curvature of the spectrum.
