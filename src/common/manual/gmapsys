SHORT DIRECTIONS to make a shim map
     -Set parameters.  Type gmapsys, click on "Set Params", then click
	on "Go, dssh".
     -Make a shimmap.  Click on "Shim Maps", then click on "Automake Shimmap".
	Enter mapname when prompted.

AUTOMATION
     -You must have the deuterium gradient shimming module installed to
         perform deuterium gradient shimming in automation.  
     -Find your 90 degree pulse on deuterium.  Enter s2pul tn='lk' tpwr=42
         pw=200 gain=20.  Enter ga.  Array pw to find the 90 degree pulse.
     -Set parameters.  Type gmapsys, click on "Set Params", then click on
        "Gradient,Nucleus".  If you have pulsed field gradients, click on
        "Pfg H2" to select parameters for deuterium with pfg.  If you have
        homospoil gradients, select "Homospoil H2" instead.  Set tpwr and
        pw for 90 degree pulse, and set gain as appropriate for your solvent.
        Then click on "Return", and click on "Go,dssh" to test the parameters.
        You should see two top-hat profile spectra.  Adjust gain and nt to
        see good signal-to-noise with no ADC overflow.
     -Recommended parameters for different solvents.

      (NOTE: Actual parameters may vary, depending on solvent concentration,
        probe, and system hardware.)
     -Make a shimmap for a particular solvent using parameters for good
        signal-to-noise.  If the solvent you use most often has weak signal,
        make the map on a solvent with more signal.  To make the map, click
        on "Shim Maps", then click on "Automake Shimmap".  Enter a mapname
        when prompted.
     -Test autoshimming.  Type "gmapsys", then click on "Autoshim on Z".
     -When you are satisfied autoshimming works well for your particular
        solvent, go to a shell window and edit the "gmapz" macro.  Go to
        the bottom of the macro, and uncomment the section appropriate for
        your solvent (the solvent the shimmap was made on).  
     -Edit the "setlk" macro and uncomment the section setting lockpower,
        lockgain, and z0 for different solvents (you must first determine
        appropriate values for different solvents).
     -Change the appropriate parameter sets in /vnmr/stdpar to use wshim='g'
        spin='y' spin=20 (or other appropriate spin value).  Use alock='y'
        if you use the "setlk" macro.  

gmapsys - enter gradient shimming system menu for:
     setting parameters
     making a shimmap
     performing autoshimming

Usage:
     gmapsys - enter gradient shimming system menu.  If the 'gmapz' pulse
	    sequence is not loaded, retrieve parameters from the last 
	    shimmap used (see current mapname), or from gmapz.par if no
	    shimmap exists.  This is the only entry point to this menu.
     gmapsys('addpar') - add gradient shimming parameters to current 
	    parameter set.
     gmapsys('setHSforH1') or gmapsys('setHSforH2') - set acquisition
	    parameters for homospoil (HS) gradients for H1 or H2 (same
            as the Homospoil H1 or Homospoil H2 buttons).  Note that 
	    gradtype='nnh' is not set by the macro or buttons, and must be
	    set manually.  On Varian 18 to 40 channel shims, make sure the
            homospoil strength is set (pot resistor HOMO on Z0 board).
     gmapsys('vi') - edit the file gshim.list, for editing shim offsets,
	    mapname, or selecting coarse/fine shims.
     gmapsys('findgzlvl') - run experiment to calibrate gzlvl, gzwin, and tof
	    to optimize the spectral window.
     gmapsys('findgzwin') - run experiment to calibrate gzwin and tof to
	    optimize the spectral window.
     gmapsys('findtof') - run experiment to center tof on the edges of the 
	    gradient.
     gmapsys('shimmap'<,'auto'|'manual'|'overwrite'|mapname>) - run a shim 
	    mapping experiment, save and display results (Make Shimmap 
	    button).  The user is first queried for a mapname.  If mapname
	    is given as second argument, the user is not queried for one.  
	    If the second argument is 'auto', first calibrate gzwin 
	    (Automake Shimmap button).  If 'manual', use shim offset values 
	    set manually from file gshim.list and not default values.
	    If 'overwrite', overwrite the current mapname if it exists.  
     gmapsys('shim') - start autoshimming (Autoshim on Z button).  
     gmapsys('rec') - display the record of shim adjustments from the previous
	    gradient shimming run.
     gmapsys('writeb0') - display the b0 plot calculated from the first two
	    array elements.
     gmapsys('quit') - quit gradient shimming and retrieve previous
	    parameter set, same as Quit button and gmapshim('quit').

     gmapshim - start autoshimming
     gmapz - retrieve standard gradient shimming parameters

Standard setup:
     Use a long water sample (recommended for first use).
     DO NOT SPIN the sample.
     If the sample is completely unshimmed, shim z1, z2, x1, and y1.  This 
	is important only for shim mapping, not for autoshimming.
     Check pulsed field gradient setup (pfgon, gradtype, gzlvl).
     Check pulse sequence.  Type gmapsys, click on "Set Params", then click
        on "Set H1" to select proton observe parameters.  Check your 90
        degree pulse, power level, and gain.  Then click on "Go, dssh" to
        produce two profile spectra.
     Check acquisition parameters for adequate signal, and to avoid 
	receiver overflow (tpwr, pw, gain, nt, ss, d1).

Make a shimmap:
     Click on "Shim Maps" and then "Automake Shimmap" to map the shims.  
	Enter a mapname when prompted, which sets the current mapname.  
	First, an experiment is run to calibrate gzwin and tof, which 
	set the active spectral window.  Next, the shim mapping experiment 
	begins.  The file is automatically processed and saved when done.
     Click on "Shimmap Files" to find and load previous shimmaps and 
	parameters.

Gradient autoshimming:
     Once a shimmap is made, click on "Autoshim on Z".  This starts 
	autoshimming with the current parameter set.  Convergence is 
	typically achieved when the rms err number is less than 1.0.  The
	shim errors estimate how well each shim may be set by this method.  
     If a shim goes out-of-range, the shim is set to full scale, and 
	shimming is continued with lower order shims.
     If more than four shims are used, autoshimming is first done on z1-z4.
	After the shims have converged, autoshimming is restarted using the 
	higher-order shims for tighter convergence.

Parameters (see dg2):
     gzsize - number of z-axis shims to adjust
     gzlvl - gradient strength
     gzwin - percentage of spectral window used for processing
     tof - center of excitation window
     d2 - gradient stabilization time
     d3 - phase accumulation time, arrayed with two values

Files:
     A directory "gshimlib" is created in the user directory.  Under 
	gshimlib is a directory "shimmaps", for storing shimmaps made 
	by gradient shimming.  There is also a directory "data", for 
	storing data files used by gradient shimming.  Some of 
	the files in "data" are displayed by expl('file',filename),
	see "Display" button under gmapsys.  Files are as follows:
	     gshim.amp   - input file (expl)
	     gshim.phase - input file (expl)
	     gshim.bas   - input file, contains shim map (expl)
	     gshim.fit   - output file (expl)
	     gshim.list  - contains shim adjustments and current mapname
	     gshim.rec   - record of shim adjustments
	     gshim.startshims - starting shim values
	The files gshim.list and gshim.bas are updated when a shimmap
	is loaded.

How a shimmap file is made:
     When you click on "Make Shimmap", you are prompted for a mapname, which 
	may be any string valid in a file name, i.e. 5mm_TrPFG_01, or the 
	probe serial number.  This name is specific to the probe, and may be
	recalled for future autoshimming.  
     At the end of the experiment, the spectra are automatically processed,
	and a file is stored in the user directory as:

	    'gshimlib/shimmaps/' + mapname + '.fid'

	In addition to the usual files stored under '.fid', the files 
	gshim.list and gshim.bas are also stored.  The file gshim.bas
	is displayed at the end of the experiment, with curves
	#1 as z1, #2 as z2, etc.  Coarse shims are used if present.
	Fine shims may be used by editing the shims with gmapsys('vi'), 
	and making a shimmap with gmapsys('shimmap','manual').
     To make a shimmap accessible to all users, make a directory 
	/vnmr/gshimlib/shimmaps (click on "Shimmap Files" and
	"Make Systemdir", you must have write permission), and copy 
	shimmap files into the directory (or click on "Copy to System").
     Once the shimmap is done, gradient shimming may be run using this
	shimmap from any other experiment by typing "gmapshim", or by 
	clicking on "Setup" and then "Shim" from the main menu, and then 
	clicking on "Gradient Autoshim on Z".
     When a mapname is retrieved by a gradient shimming macro or menu, the
	parameters are usually retrieved, and the files gshim.list and 
	gshim.bas are copied from the shimmaps directory to the data directory 
	in gshimlib.  These files must be present while autoshimming.  The 
	parameters used to make the shimmap are the same ones used for 
	autoshimming, unless altered by the user.
     To remove a shim map, remove the file mapname+'.fid' or 
	mapname+'.par' in the shimmaps directory.

Hints:
     The parameter gzwin must be calibrated before running the shimmap 
	experiment.  tof may be different than on resonance with solvent.
	The profile should be symmetric in the spectral window.
     The number of shims to shim on may be adjusted using the parameter
	gzsize, and does not require making a new shimmap if gzsize is
	smaller than the shimmap.
     Make sure the probe is in the same position as when the shimmap was made.
     To manually set the shim offsets, use gmapsys('vi') to edit the file 
	gshim.list and change the values in the "Offset" column.  Then type 
	gmapsys('shimmap','manual') to start the shimmap.  The user is not 
	queried for a new mapname.
     Increase the number of transients nt or signal-to-noise to reduce the 
	shim errors.  Typically, one may first shim with small nt, and then 
	increase nt to obtain greater precision.  Increasing the value of 
	d3[2] may also increase signal-to-noise, unless T2* is too short.  
	To save a shimmap with a different nt or other parameters for later 
	use, load a shimmap, change the parameters, then click on "Shim Maps" 
	and then "Save As".
     Evaluate a set of shims for a specific application (i.e. presat).  
	Results may vary with application.
     To use homospoil gradients, set gradtype='nnh' and enter 
	gmapsys('setHSforH1') or gmapsys('setHSforH2') to select starting 
	parameters.  Use the 'Go, dssh' button to first obtain good para-
	meters before attempting to make a shimmap.  On the Varian 13 and 
	Oxford 18 shims, homospoil strength may be too weak.  The parameters 
	needed may also be hardware dependent.  (See Liquids manual.)
     Manual adjustment of the non-spin (xy) shims, especially the low-order 
	shims, may be necessary.  The non-spins also contain some z-components,
	and additional gradient shimming on z may be necessary.

To shim samples other than water:
     Make a shimmap on a water sample of equal height, then insert sample,
	adjust parameters to obtain sufficient signal, and start autoshimming.
     Set parameters to obtain sufficient proton signal, then make a shimmap 
	and start autoshimming.
     Use gradient shimming on another sample of equal height, then insert the 
	sample and adjust low-order shims using other methods.
     Set the observe transmitter to deuterium.  Click on "Set Params" and
	"Set H2" to set reasonable starting parameters.  You may need to
	disconnect the lock and recable the system to pulse on deuterium using 
	the lock coil.  Use "Go, dssh" to check the parameters.  Then follow 
	the usual procedures to make a shimmap and autoshim, both of which 
	should be performed while pulsing on deuterium.

Troubleshooting:
     Make sure the gradients are active (check gradtype, pfgon).
     DO NOT SPIN while running gradient shimming experiments.  This may
	result in data artifacts.
     Gradient shimming is very sensitive to sample geometry and probe
	positioning.
