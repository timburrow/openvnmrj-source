 f19 - Automated Fluorine Acquisition  (M)
*******************************************************************************

      Syntax: f19<(solvent)>

 Description: prepares parameters for automatically acquiring a standard
	        F19 spectrum.  wexp is set to procplot for standard
                processing. If f19 is used as the command for automation
                via the enter command, then the au is supplied automatically
                and should not be entered on the MACRO line of the enter
                program.  However, it is possible to customize the standard
                f19 macro on the MACRO line by following it with additional
                commands and parameters.  For example, f19 nt=1 will use the
                standard f19 setup but with only one transient.

   Arguments: solvent - the name of the solvent (default: CDCl3); in automation
		mode the solvent is supplied by the enter program.

    Examples: f19 au
	      f19('DMSO') ernst(5) au
	      f19('Acetone') d1=5 pw(90) au
