FLUORINE: Setup parameters for FLUORINE spectrum

The acquisition of FLUORINE has slightly different setup considerations because of
the wide spectral window.  The true down-sampled dwell time is 1/sw and as sw becomes
large the dwell time can become very small relative to the probe ring down parameter
rof2. At setup time backwards linear prediction parameters are automatically set in
concert with the direct digital receiver time constant (ddrtc) so that phasing with
a lp=0 condition can be achieved.

Many NMR probes have 19F background and an easy way to suppress such broad lines would
be to enter a longer value for rof2 in the F19 tab of the probe file.

If the user desires a special setup step for 19F NMR this is easily acheived by the
creation of a local userFLUORINE macro. A macro called FLUORINE_plot would define how
routine 19F data would be plotted.
