 tnnoesy -  2D cross relaxation experiment
                TRANSMITTER SOLVENT SATURATION ONLY
                ASSUMES ON-RESONANCE SOLVENT (tof is at solvent position)

   satmode  determines when the saturation happens. Satmode should be set
            analogously to dm, i.e. satmode='yyyn' or 'ynyn' etc.
   satpwr = power level during saturation period(s)
   satdly = length of presaturation period (saturation may also occur
            in d2 and mix as determined by satmode)
   sspul = 'y': selects for Trim(x)-Trim(y) sequence at start of pulse sequence

   (requires system with linear amplifier on observe channel and T/R switch)

NOTE: the tnnoesy pulse sequence is not supplied with Mercury and GEMINI 2000.
