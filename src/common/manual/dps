 filename: The pulse sequence to be displayed.
 x, y:     The coordinates on the screen or plotter, in mm.
 width:    The width on the screen or plotter, in mm.
 height:   The height on the screen or plotter, in mm.

  "dps" and "pps" will display or plot the pulse sequence specified by the
  parameter "filename" or if no parameter, the default seqfile.
  "dpsn" will display the the pulse sequence without erasing screen.
  The displayed picture consists of three to five parts. The top part is the
  transmitter pulse sequence. The second part is the decoupler pulse sequence.
  The third part may be the third decoupler pulse sequence or gradients 
  depending on the program.  The lowest part is the status.
  The parameter of pulses will be displayed if its length is less than thirty 
  letters and consists at the most, one operator.
  The value of each pulse will also be displayed. If its value is less than 
  zero, the question mark "?" will then be displayed.
  The time units may be displayed in colors (in color monitor) or letters (s,
  m, or u).
  The height of pulses will be displayed according to their power level.
