unlock(exp#)	-  remove inactive lock from experiment and join
unlock(exp#,'force') -  force removal of lock from experiment and join
*************************************************************************

If you attempt to join another experiment, the JEXP command may abort,
claiming the experiment is locked.  This feature prevents two people
from processing the same experimental data at the same time, which
could corrupt the data.

This lock can be left behind if the program or the computer crashes.
The "unlock" command will remove the lock if it is inactive.  It needs
one argument, the number of the experiment to be unlocked.  It will
fail if the lock is still active, that is, the process that made the
lock is still executing, or if the lock was placed on the experiment
by a remote host.  The latter situation can only occur when one or more
nodes are sharing the same file system (and experimental data).
The force option will unlock the experiment under all circumstances.

example:  unlock(3)     will unlock and join experiment 3.
