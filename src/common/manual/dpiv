              dpivn<(vertical_position)>

 Description: Labels integrals with a bracket below the spectrum and a
	      vertical number indicating the integral value, improved over
	      dpir /dpirn / pir / pirn:
    		- vertical labels, allowing for narrower regions
    		- avoids label overlap by label shifting
    		- more flexible vertical positioning
	      The vertical position defaults to a location just underneath the
	      scale labels, assuming there is enough room below the scale. If
	      the vertical position is too low, the vertical position is
	      allowed to approach the position of the spectrum up to 1 mm.
	      If the spectral position is so low that the integral labels
	      would overlap with the spectrum, an error message is produced
	      (indicating the minimum vp), and the command aborts. No error
	      message is produced in case of overlap with the scale. The
	      minimum for vp depends on the plotter and the character size,
	      and in the case of 'dpiv' also on the size of the graphics
	      window.
	      With an optional argument the vertical position can be forced to
	      any value, no checking is done, and no error message will be
	      produced in case of overlap. piv(vp-2) will produce integral
	      labels with the brackets ending 2 mm below the position of the
	      spectrum.

	      For VNMR versions up to 5.2, "dpiv" and its relatives work as
	      expected ("piv" and "dpiv" produce integral labels indicating
	      integral sizes in mm, controlled by "is"). For newer VNMR
	      releases, "dpiv" follows the new convention: the output is no
   	      longer controlled by "is", but rather by "ins" and "insref".
	      If you like to restore the "old" integration mode, you can
	      simply create a (local or global) parameter "oldint" and set it
	      to 'y':
			create('oldint','flag','global')
			oldint='y'
	      to switch back to the default integration mode in VNMR 5.3 and
	      higher, either set "oldint='n'", or destroy the parameter.

    Examples: vp=25 dpiv
	      vp=50 pl pscale piv(0)
