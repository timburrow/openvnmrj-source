*******************************************************************************
status<(autodir <,configuration_file> )>   - show status of an Automation run
*******************************************************************************

This command can be used in vnmr system or in UNIX shell. The autodir option is the 
pathname of the directory where the done queue ('doneQ') is stored.
If it is in vnmr, then the option can be used or not. If not, the automation 
mode directory will be used.  In the UNIX shell, the option must be the pathname
of the done queue location.  The optional configuration file is the name of a
user-supplied file that customizes status for local use.  Refer to the
User Programming manual for details.

The status command will update itself as the state of an automation run changes.
If an experiment finishes, or a new experiment is added, the status display will
be updated.
