    readallshims reads all the shims from hardware and sets them into
        the shim parameters in the current parameter tree.

    setallshims sets all the shims from the current parameter tree into 
        hardware.  It is equivalent to load='y' su without setting all the 
        hardware parameters normally set by su (temp, decoupling, 
        transmitter initialization, etc).

For both macros, the shims used depend on the shimset configuration.  
For the UltraShims shimset, these macros are active only if hardware-software 
shim communication is enabled.
