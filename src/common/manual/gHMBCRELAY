Process as sum [ wft2d(1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1) ] for nJch or as
difference [ wft2d(1,0,-1,0,0,1,0,-1) ] for 2Jch

PARAMETERS

Typical Parameter Values (Performa II or Triax, Scale down for Performa I)
  gzlvl1 = 6000
  gzlvl3 = 3000

Transfer Delays
  j1xh = 140 
  jnxh = 8
  jhh  = 6  Calculated delay is 1/(16*jhh) NOT 1/(4*jhh).
  fad  = 'y' - Provided as a convenience only.
  shapedpulse = 'y' for on the fly adiabatic 13C 180s
  shapedpulse = 'n' used simple hard 180s
  phase = 1,2  - Must be acquired with with this phase array to afford 2Jch selective editing.

2Jch dependent more upon jhh than jnxh because of the pseudo-cosy relay step.
Use sqsinebell window function in both dimensions.
