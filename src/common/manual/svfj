      Syntax: svfj<(filename<,opt>)>
	      svsj<(filename<,opt>)>
	      svlsj<(filename<,opt>)>
	      svxyj<(filename)>
	      svllj<(filename<,'all'><,'noll'>)>

 Description: "svfj" saves the current 1D FID in JCAMP-DX format. 
	        "svfj" creates temporary files "/vnmr/tmp/jdxfid.real" and
		"/vnmr/tmp/jdxfid.imag"; it calls two external C programs
		"listparam" and "jdxfid". Only a single FID (the current
		trace in the case of an arrayed experiment) is saved.
		"svfj" does not work with nf>1.

	      "svsj" saves the current 1D spectrum in JCAMP-DX format.
		"svsj" creates a temporary file "/vnmr/tmp/jdxspec"; it calls
		two external C programs "listparam" and "jdxspec". Only a
		single 1D trace (the current trace in the case of an arrayed
		experiment) is saved; "svsj" does not work on 2D data after
		"wft1d" or "wft2d", but 2D data can be treated as arrayed 1D
		data sets using "wft" / "ft", which again permits saving traces.

	      "svlsj" is the same as "svsj", except that the spectrum is
		saved with 8 extra bits of digital precision ("svsj" saves
		spectra with 16-bit precision), for spectra with very large
		dynamic range.

	      "svxyj" is similar to "svsj", except that the spectrum is
		written out in X,Y (2-column) format, with referenced X
		values and Y values directly in mm (the other JCAMP-DX
		formats use a simple integer X and Y values, the scaling
		and referencing information is stored in header fields.
		NOTE: most JCAMP-DX import software expects "svsj" / "svlsj"
		output. "svxyj" output uses no compression - the resulting
		files are much bigger than with any of the output options of
		the other JCAMP-DX conversion macros for full spectra.

	      "svllj" saves a peak listing in X,Y format. If a file "dept.out"
		exists in the current experiment, peak multiplicities are
		added to the output as well (X,Y,M format).

   Arguments: "filename" is the name of the target file. If no filename is
		supplied, the software checks if "file" differs from "exp"
		(i.e., you have used "rt" to load the dataset from disk).
		If "file<>'exp'" and if the FID file is writable, then the
		JCAMP-DX data are saved as "{file}/dx_name.dx", where "{file}"
		has ".fid" added, if necessary, and "dx_name.dx" is the
		"basename" part of "file" (minus the ".fid" extension).
		If "file='exp'" or if the FID directory is not writable, the
		user is prompted for the filename.
		The resulting ASCII file by default has a ".dx" extension,
		unless the specified filename has an alternative extension.
		(the default can be altered in the header of the macro).
		NOTE: ALL files created - whether they are FIDs, spectra or
		      line lists - have the same (default) extension (the
		      distinction between FIDs and spectra is made within
		      the JCAMP-DX format); it is up to the user to avoid
		      overwriting files!
		Where multiple arguments are specified / allowed, "filename"
		MUST be the first argument.

	      "all" ("svllj" only) causes solvent signals to be included in
		the peak listing (multiplicity marked as "U" = unassigned)

	      "noll" ("svllj" only) causes "svllj" NOT to re-evaluate the
		line listing - the contents of the parameters "llfrq" and
		"llamp" are used instead.

	      "opt" is an optional argument that permits controlling the
 	 	compression in the data part of the JCAMP-DX file. Possible
		options and their effects are:

		     -------------- option --------------
                     tbl  fix  pac  sqz  dup  dif  difdup  Effect, description
                     ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ------
                X,Y   X    -    -    -    -    -     -    X,Y list
                FIX   -    X    -    -    -    -     -    X(Y..Y), readable
                PAC   -    -    X    -    -    -     -    X(Y..Y), packed
                SQZ   -    -    -    X    X    X     X    X(Y..Y), squeezed
                DIF   -    -    -    -    -    X     X    SQZ, differences
                DUP   -    -    -    -    X    -     X    SQZ, DUP mode

		The default mode / option is "'difdup'" which usually gives
		the best compression. For human-readable data use the "'fix'"
		option, for programs expecting output in X Y format (one
		ordinate value per line) use the "'tbl'" option. All format
		options comply with the JCAMP-DX format and should be usable.
		"opt" cannot be specified with "svxyj".

    Examples: svfj
	      svfj('myfid')
	      svfj('myfid.jdx','dup')
	      select(3) svfj('myfid_3')
	      svsj
              svsj('myspectrum')
              svsj('myspectrum','fix')
              select(3) svsj('myspectrum_3')
	      svlsj
              svlsj('myspectrum')
