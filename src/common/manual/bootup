bootup	-	Macro executed automatically, when VNMR is activated
******************************************************************************

  When VNMR is activated, a macro named bootup is executed.  The system
  supplied macro displays a message, will run a macro named login if
  it exists, starts Acqstat and acqi if the system is not configured
  as a workstation, and then starts the menu system.
  This behavior may be modified on a per user basis by constructing
  a private bootup macro in the user's maclib.  Another alternative
  is to provide a custom login macro in your private maclib.
  The bootup macro is provided with a single argument which signifies
  whether Vnmr  is being run in foreground or not.  If $1=0, then Vnmr
  is being run in foreground.  If $1<>0, then Vnmr is being run in
  background.  This argument is passed to the login macro.
