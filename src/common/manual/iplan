iplan is an interactive image planning macro.  Iplan is a macro server loop
  with drawn on screen control buttons.  Iplan captures mouse control in VNMR
  so that one clicks the exit screen button to leave.  The server brings up a
  transverse slice specification tool (see tbox command). By choosing a button
  in the graphics area, the tool may be stretched, tilted, and moved. The number
  of slices and the area they cover may also be adjusted. The exit button calls
  the rsliceplan macro to load these setting for the next images.
