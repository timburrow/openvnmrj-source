killft3d:  usage  -  killft3d(exp_no)


killft3d is a macro that terminates any ft3d program which has been
started in the VNMR experiment specified by the argument 'expno'.
This argument is mandatory.  There is no restriction that the user
must execute the killft3d macro from within the experiment in which
the ft3d program to be killed was started.  Additionally, the rele-
vant 3D data subdirectory is also deleted for each ft3d process
terminated by killft3d.  Remote ft3d processes, denoted by the call
name ftr3d in the process table (ps ax), are not directly terminated
by killft3d but die of their on accord due to the deletion of the 3D
data subdirectory.

killft3d can also be run as a shellscript from UNIX.  Its function
is analogous to the associated VNMR macro.
