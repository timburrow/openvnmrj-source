    These macros are used to process kinetics data obtained using 
    an array of values for the parameter, 'pad', preacquisition delay.

    For an signal that decreases exponentially with time, the output
    is matched to the equation

    	I = A1 * EXP(-T/TAU) + A3.

    The analysis is done by the macro 'kind' or by 'kinds' if a
    short output table is desired.
    
    If the signal increases exponentially to a limit, the output 
    is matched by

    	I = -A1 * EXP(-T/TAU) + A3 - A1.

    with  analysis done by the macro 'kini' or by 'kinis' for a
    short output table.  The output table is the file analyze.list
    in the current experiment.
    
    The required input is the file 'fp.out' from running 'fp' and the 
    values of the arrayed parameter.

    The T1/T2 analysis is done for all the peaks listed in the
    'fp.out'.  Peaks are selected for analysis by typing
		fp(index1,index2,...)
    prior to running the analysis.

    
    The following steps may be used in processing a Kinetics experiment: 
    	1. Type: wft dssh
    	2. Type: full ds aph
    	3. Click Next on the menu, then Thresh; use left mouse
    	   button to set threshold
    	4. Type: dll fp
    	5  Type: kind, kini, kinds, or kinis
    	6. If desired, adjust 'sc', 'wc', 'sc2', and 'wc2' by 
    	   typing 'center' or 'full'
    	7. Type: expl.
