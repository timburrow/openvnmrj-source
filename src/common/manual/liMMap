******************************************************************************
liMMap(cs<,fullpath>) - calculate csi map of integrals for a peak specified by chemical shift cs. 

liMMap(freq1, freq2<,fullpath>) - calculate csi map of integrals for a peak defined by freq1, freq2. 
******************************************************************************

map is saved in fdf format, in identical format as images.

Default map path is xxx.csi/maps/li_<chem_shift_ppm>. User specified map path should be fullpath with map name, but without suffix .fdf. 

cs is chemical shift of the peak, which can be specified by cr (cursor).
freq1, freq2 are absolute frequencies (as in lifrq). 

Parameters llfrq and lifrq are used to determine peak position and integral region.
If peak cs is given, lifrq is searched to determine integral region for peak cs. If not found, the entire spectrum region will be integrated. This gives a full integral csi map (csi image). 
If freq1, freq2 are given, llfrq is search to determine peak position. If not found, peak position will be 0.5*(freq1+freq2).

Multiple fdf maps will be created for multi-slice csi data, with default naming xxx.csi/maps/li_<chem_shift_ppm>_n.fdf, where n is slice index.

A single 3D fdf map will be created for 3D csi data.
