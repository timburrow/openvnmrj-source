PROTON: Experiment using the s2pul pulse sequence set to acquire a 1H 1D dataset

The parameter set called PROTON is special in that it is the building block for
most common liquids NMR small molecule experiments. The default of course is for the
parameter tn (transmitter nucleus) to be set to H1. The parameter dn (decoupler nucleus)
is set to C13 because that is the most likely "other" spin involved.  Either of these
parameters may be changed to any legal value as desired.

The loading of this parameter set is assisted by the application-type (apptype) macro
called std1D.  If a user desires a specific customization of the setup process this
is most conveniently achieved by the creation of a macro called userPROTON. Imagine
that the user desired that all 2D experiments following the acquisition of a PROTON
experiment be acquired after a 2nd PROTON was acquired with a spectral window reduced
automatically. Such a userPROTON macro would just contain the line MinSW='auto'. If
it was desired to reduce the spectral window for all subsequent 2Ds but not actually
acquire a 2nd PROTON dataset the userPROTON macro would contain the line MinSW='skip'.

The creation of a macro called PROTON_plot would mean that automatic plotting would
proceed using the macro by that name.
