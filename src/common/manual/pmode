*	pmode  -  processing mode for 2D data		*

*********************************************************

The parameter pmode is in the processing group and specifies the type
of 2D spectral data that the 2D-FT will yield.  pmode can take the
string values '', 'partial', and 'full'.  If the parameter pmode does
not exist, it is assigned a value of 'partial' internal to Vnmr.



PMODE = '':

In this processing mode, it is not possible to change either the F2
or F1 display mode after the 2D FT.  If the F2 display mode has been
set to phased (dmg = 'ph'), each F2 spectrum is phase rotated using
the phase constants "rp" and "lp" prior to the FT along the second
dimension.  If the F2 display mode has been set to power or absolute
value (dmg = 'pwr' or 'av' respectively), however, the F2 spectrum is
not processed any further after the first FT.  The complex t1 inter-
ferograms are handled in a similar manner.  If the F1 display mode has
been set to phased (dmg1 = 'ph1'), each F1 spectrum is phased using the
phase constants "rp1" and "lp1".  If the display mode has been set to
power (dmg1 = 'pwr1') or to absolute value, the appropriate magnitude
calculation is performed, with the result being placed in the REAL part
of the appropriate complex datum and a 0 being placed in the IMAGINARY
part. At the end of the 2D transform, the spectral data file (datdir/data)
is reduced from complex data to real data (Vnmr REDUCE display message).



PMODE = 'partial':

In this processing mode, it is not possible to change the F2 display
mode after the 2D FT; it is possible, however, to select between the
three F1 display modes without having to reprocess the 2D data.  If
the F2 display mode has been set to phased (dmg = 'ph'), each F2 spectrum
is phase rotated using the phase constants "rp" and "lp" prior to the
FT along the second dimension.  If the F2 display mode has been set to
power or absolute value (dmg = 'pwr' or 'av' respectively), the F2
spectrum is not processed any further after the first FT.  Regardless of
the requested F1 display mode, no further processing is performed by
FT2D on the F1 spectra after the second FT.  The calculations on the
2D spectral data necessary to achieve the requested F1 display mode are
performed by DCON or DCONI.



PMODE = 'full':

In this processing mode, it is possible to select between the three
display modes for each dimension without having to reprocess the 2D
data.  Regardless of any requested display mode, no display mode pro-
cessing is performed by FT2D on the F2 spectra after the first or
second FT.  Display mode processing is performed exclusively by DCON
or DCONI.

The hypercomplex data structure for the 2D time domain data is

	{Re(t1)Re(t2), Re(t1)Im(t2), Im(t1)Re(t2), Im(t1)Im(t2)}

and is experimentally composed by the PSG arraying mechanism.  The
hypercomplex data structure for the t1 interferograms is

	{Re(t1)Re(F2), Re(t1)Im(F2), Im(t1)Re(F2), Im(t1)Im(F2)}

where Re represents the Real part and Im, the imaginary part.  A hyper-
complex FT along t1 yields a hypercomplex 2D spectrum with the following
data structure per hypercomplex point:

	{Re(F1)Re(F2), Re(F1)Im(F2), Im(F1)Re(F2), Im(F1)Im(F2)}

Note that if pmode='full',  the ft2d program will require an array
index or coefficients for the construction of the t1 interferograms.
