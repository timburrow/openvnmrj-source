 hcchtocsy- Used for sidechain assignments in fully C13-enriched molecules

    Optional C13 decoupling of carbonyl carbons during t2 uses a 180
    degree pulse done through a shaped SLP(phase-ramped) pulse. C13
    xmtr is normally in aliphatic region(do not try for both aliphatic
    and aromatic hcchtocsy-bandwidth too large for good spinlock). This
    pulse is of length pwco at power pwcolvl and of name coshape.

    Determine the length, nature and power for this 180 in an on-resonance
    calibration experiment. Then prepare this pulse by preparing a "template"
    pulse of having 5 times as many steps as width in usec. Convolute this
    to prepare the SLP pulse.

    For example, if at a pwcolvl of 38 a sinc pulse does a 180 in 250usec when
    on resonance, for the most accuracy you would need a shapelib sinc.RF file
    of 250*5 steps. [For rectangular pulses you can use "makehard(# of steps)"
    to do this. For complex shapes you can generate out of pulsetool or by
    a separate program.] If this sinc pulse has the name sinc1250.RF, and the
    distance from the C13 xmtr is say 15,000 Hz, prepare the new shape by
        convolute('sinc1250','co180_1250us_+15000',250,15000).

    This gives you a shape that is used by decshaped_pulse to do a 180 on
    the carbonyl region when your dof is positioned in the aliphatic region.
    Use "pulsetool" to verify that your shape is correct.

    It is not necessary to do carbonyl decoupling. The only visible effect
    will be a CC splitting in F2 for alpha carbons. If not desired set pwco=0.


    Set dm = 'nny', [13C decoupling during acquisition]
    One dipsi-3 cycle is 217.33*p1
      e.g. if p1= 36us a single dipsi cycle is 7.8ms

    Must set phase = 1,2 and phase2 = 1,2 for hypercomplex in t1 and t2.

    Typical acquisition times are 28 ms [t1], 10 ms [t2], and 47 ms [t3]
       with 128 complex [t1], 32 complex [t2], and 512 real [t3].
