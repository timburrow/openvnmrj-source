VBG is a UNIX shellscript to allow the user to perform VNMR
tasks in background.  VBG stands for Vnmr Background proces-
sing.


VBG may take up to 3 arguments in the following format:

		vbg   arg#1   "arg#2"   <arg#3>

The <>'s around arg#3 indicate that arg#3 is optional.  The
first two arguments are NOT optional.  The " "'s around arg#2
are also mandatory.


Arg#1 is the number of an experiment in the user's directory
in which the background processing is to take place.  "Arg#2"
is the command string, e.g., "fn=4096 fn1=2048 wft2da", which
is to be executed by Vnmr in background.  Arg#3 is an optional
prefix for the name of the log file.


The log file is placed in the experiment in which the background
processing takes place.  If arg#3 is not supplied, the default
name of the log file is:  EXP#_BGP.LOG where # is the experiment
number defined by arg#1.  If arg#3 is suppled, the name of the
log file is:   ARG#3_BGP.LOG.


VBG must be run from within a UNIX shell.  Furthermore, NO fore-
ground or other background processes may be active in the desig-
nated experiment.  For instance, if one is working in EXP2 in
Vnmr (in foreground), then one cannot execute background proces-
sing in EXP2 as well.


Foreground processing causes a lock file to be placed in the ap-
propriate experiment, e.g., f.1268 where 1268 indicates the
process number in the process table (accessed in UNIX by typing:
ps -ax).  Background processing causes a lock file to be in the
appropriate experiment as well, e.g., b.4356 where 4356 also
indicates the process number in the process table.  By displaying
the files within an experiment, one can readily determine whether
any foreground or background processes are active in that experi-
ment.
