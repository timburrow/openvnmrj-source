pcmapgen	Generate Phase Correction Map (C) 
**************************************************************************
Syntax:		pcmapgen([<filename>,]<index>)


Description:	"pcmapgen" generates pixel by pixel complex phase correction
		values from the current datafile and stores them into the 
		<index> block in the phase correction map file
		$vnmruser/expN/datdir/<filename>.

		It assumes the phase correction map file to store the values 
		resides in the user's $vnmruser/expN/datdir directory where 
		N is the current experiment number.  If the "filename"
		argument is not given, the command defaults to the filename
		"pcmap".  The "index" argument must always be supplied,
		ranges from 1 to n, and specifies the desired correction map
		block within the file.

		One or more phase correction maps may be generated, although
		they can only be generated one at a time.  As mentioned
		before, the command uses data from the current datafile;
		which means that a fourier transform must have been
		performed on the data.  For images, a "ft1d" should be
		done on the data before using this command.

		"pcmapgen" will create, open, and close the phase map file 
		unless it has been explicitly opened with "pcmapopen".  
		Explicitly opening a phase correction map file may be desired 
		if there are a large number of images or data sets to be 
		processed.

		The "pcmap" commands have been developed for processing 
		Echo Planar images, but can also be used for other 
		applications if applicable. 


Arguments:	'filename' optional argument specifying the phase correction
		map file name residing in the user's $vnmruser/expN/datdir
		directory.  The default file is $vnmruser/expN/datdir/pcmap.

		'index' argument specifying which phase correction map to use
		in the file.  This value will usually be 1.


 Example:	ft1d('nf',1)
		pcmapgen(1)
