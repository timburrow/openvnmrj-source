*******************************************************************************

  "dfs", "dfsa", and "dfsh" display one or more FIDs.  "plfid" will
  plot one or more FIDs.  If 'imag' is supplied as an argument to
  dfs, dfsh, dfsa, plfid, or pfww then only the imaginary FID channel
  is displayed or plotted.

  For arrayed 1-D or for 2-D data sets, a particular FID can
  be viewed by supplying the index number as an argument.
  Multiple FIDs can be displayed by supplying the indexes of the
  first and last FIDs.  The optional "step" argument is the increment
  for the FID index (default is 1).  For example, to display 
  every third FID, use "dfs(1,arraydim,3)".  (arraydim is set to the
  total number of FIDs).  The argument 'all' may be used to display
  all of the FIDs.  'all' is the default for the FID display programs,
  and for the pfww command.  It is not the default for plfid.  plfid
  defaults to the currently selected FID.

  The position of the first FIDs is governed by the parameters
  "wc", "sc", and "vpf".  A subsequent FID is positioned relative to
  the preceding FID by the parameters "vo" (vertical offset) and
  "ho" (horizontal offset).
  The letter 'a' in the command name automatically adjusts the parameters
  "vo" and "ho" to fill the screen in a lower left to upper right
  presentation ("wc" must be set to less than full screen width for this
  to work).
  The letter 'h' in the command name causes "vo" to be set to zero. "ho",
  "sc", and "wc" are adjusted to fill the screen from left to right with
  the entire array.  That is, the FIDs are displayed horizontally.

  A final letter 'n' in the command name prevents the graphics screen
  from being erased.  This allows "composite displays" of many FIDs
  to be created.

  dfww is a command which provides "white-washing",  that is,  FIDs
  after the first one are blanked out in regions in which they are
  "behind" the earlier FIDs.  pfww is the equivalent command which
  causes the "white-washed" FIDs to be plotted.

  An optional color or pen number can be supplied to dfs or plfid.  The
  available colors and pens are:
        'red','green','blue','cyan','magenta','yellow','black','white'
        'pen1','pen2','pen3', ...
