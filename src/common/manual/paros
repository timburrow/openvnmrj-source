Two types of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) are provided for the acquisition
of data.  One is "real-time" DSP, which uses a special purpose
computer in the acquisition system.  The second is the "inline" DSP,
in which the digital filtering and downsampling are done on the Sun
immediately after each oversampled FID is transferred from the console.
Only the digital filtered and downsampled data is written to disk.
This inline DSP also allows selective detection a region of a
spectrum. A third type of DSP is provided which allows post-processing
of data.  See manual for pards for details.

The selection of "real-time" or "inline" DSP is selected with the global
parameter dsp.  The dsp parameter can be set to 'r' for real-time or 'i'
for inline.  If the parameter is not present or is set to 'n', then DSP
is disabled.  Note that dsp should not be set to 'r' unless the DSP hardware
is actually present in the system.  If either real-time or inline DSP
is active, then the filter bandwidth parameter (fb) is set to Not Active.

To use this software, "sw" and "at" should be set to the values desired
for the final spectrum.  The paros macro creates all of the necessary
parameters.  It is also called when addpar('oversamp') is typed.
It is also called automatically if dsp='i' or dsp='r'.

If dsp='i', setting the "oversamp" parameter to a value greater than 1
will cause the next experiment run to be oversampled, digital filtered and
downsampled back to the selected sw prior to saving it to disk.

After acquiring a data set without digital filtering, the moveossw macro can be
used to set oslsfrq and sw to appropriate values for oversampling and
digitally filtering to select the region of the spectrum selected by
the cursors in the ds display.  oversamp must be manually set to an
appropriate value (set "oversamp" above).

The parameters created by paros are the following:

oversamp:

This parameter specifies the oversampling factor for the acquisition.
np*oversamp data points are acquired at a rate of sw*oversamp.  Once
the data has been transferred to the Sun computer, it is digitally filtered
and downsampled to give np points and a spectral width of sw.  sw*oversamp
must be less than or equal to 100 kHz and np*oversamp must be less than
512k.  Oversampling is also limited to be less than or equal to 20.
Setting oversamp to 'n' will cause normal acquisition to be
done without digital filtering.

oscoef:

This parameter specifies the number of coefficients used in the digital
filter.  For the inline DSP, the default is 32 times the oversampling
factor plus 1.  For the real-time DSP, the number of coefficients is
not adjustable but is determined by the hardware.  A larger number of
coefficients will give a filter with sharper cutoffs, and a smaller
number of coefficients will give a filter with more gradual cutoffs.
oscoef does not need to be changed as oversamp is changed, as it is
automatically adjusted by Vnmr to give filter cutoffs which are the
same regardless of the value of oversamp.

oslsfrq:

This parameter is used to select a bandpass filter that is not centered
about the transmitter frequency.  oslsfrq is specified in Hz and works
much like lsfrq.  A positive value of oslsfrq will select a region upfield
from the transmitter frequency and a negative value will select a downfield
region.

osfb:

This parameter specifies the bandwidth of the digital filter that is used.
If osfb='n' it defaults to sw/2.  A smaller value will reject frequencies
at the edges of the spectrum, and a larger value will alias noise and
signals at frequencies outside of +/- sw/2.

filtfile:

This parameter specifies the filename of a file of FIR digital filter
coefficients.  The file must be in the user's vnmrsys/filtlib directory.
The filter coefficient file is a text file with one real filter
coefficient per line.  Complex filters are not currently supported.
