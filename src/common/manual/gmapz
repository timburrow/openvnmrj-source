Gradient shimming uses phase accumulation from shim gradients present during 
phase-sensitive slice selection.  Phase accumulation from all gradients 
is as follows:

   phi  =  z Gz (-at/2 - d2 + t)  +  dB (d3 + at/2 + 3*d2 + t)

           Gz is the z-axis pulsed field gradient strength 
           dB is the sum of the shim gradient fields, shown as being on
		during relevant times in the pulse sequence
           t is the time during acquisition time at

The effect of the shim gradients dB may be isolated by arraying d3, and 
taking the difference in the phases.

   phi2 - phi1  =  dB * (d3[2] - d3[1])
   i.e.  (phi2 - phi1) ~ 2pi * 100Hz * 10 ms ~ 2pi radians

The effect of any one shim gradient may be isolated by arraying that 
particular shim, and taking the difference in the phase differences.  

   (phi4-phi3) - (phi2-phi1) = dB[2]*(d3[2] - d3[1]) - dB[1]*(d3[2] - d3[1])
                             = (dB[2] - dB[1]) * (d3[2] - d3[1])

By arraying all the shim values, a set of shim maps may be constructed for 
a given set of shims.  Shimming may then be performed by constructing a field 
map for the starting shim values (phi2 - phi1), and fitting the result to the 
shim maps.  The calculation time is usually much shorter than the data
acquisition time, so the entire process typically takes only a few minutes!

Parameters (see dg2):
   gzsize  -  number of z-axis shims to adjust
   gzlvl   -  gradient strength
   gzwin   -  percentage of spectral window used for phase map 
	        calculation, relevant slice profile
   d2	   -  gradient stabilization time
   d3	   -  phase accumulation time, arrayed to two values
   pw	   -  pulse length, need not be 90 if p1=0
   p1	   -  if > 0, it is used between the gradient pulses as a 180
		refocusing pulse, and the gradients have the same sign

Recommendations: 
   -Check that the pulsed field gradients are active (pfgon, gradtype).
   -DO NOT SPIN.
   -Current implementation is for z-gradients only.  Manual adjustment 
      of the non-spin (xy) shims may also be necessary.
