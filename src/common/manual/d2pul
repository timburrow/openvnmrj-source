D2PUL: Standard Two-Pulse Sequence Using Decoupler as Transmitter

The decoupler offset "dof" should equal the transmitter offset "tof"
for proper signal detection.
Parameter homo must be set to 'n'

UNITYplus, UNITY and VXR-S:
The parameter "tpwr", instead of "dhp", controls the decoupler power
level during pulses for systems equipped with a linear amplifier on 
the decoupler RF channel.  The parameter "dhp" controls the decoupler
power level at all other times during a pulse sequence for this type
of system configuration.

For systems with Class C decoupler amplifiers, "dhp" is set to 255 by
DECLVLON during all pulses and is reset to its parameter value for all
other times during the pulse sequence.

Mercury:
GEMINI 2000:
On these systems the software automatically switches transmitters based
on 'tn' and 'dn'. Use 's2pul' instead and set tn='H1' and dn='C13'.
