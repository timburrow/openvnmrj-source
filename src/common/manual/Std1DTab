The Std 1D Tab Family

This experiment selector tab is a convenient listing of very commonly used one
dimensional  small molecule liquids experiments.  These experiments are by default:

PROTON - sets parameters to acquire a 1H NMR 1D dataset using the s2pul sequence. In
the std1D apptype family.

CARBON - sets parameters to acquire a 1H-decoupled 13C NMR 1D dataset using the s2pul
sequence. In the std1D apptype family.

FLUORINE - sets parameters to acquire a 19F NMR 1D dataset using the s2pul sequence. In
the std1D apptype family.

PHOSPHORUS - sets parameters to acquire a 1H-decoupled 31P 1D dataset using the s2pul
sequence. In the std1D apptype fammily.

(C)APT - sets parameters to acquire a 13C experiment with gated decoupling and
refocusing to yield a 13C spectrum with the phase of the carbons a function of the
number of attached protons. Thus the name APT for Attached Protons Test.

(C)DEPT - sets parameters to acquire a 13C DEPT (Distortionless Enhancement by
Polarization Transfer) data set useful for complete editing of 13C spectra by type of
carbon: quaternary, methine, methylene, or methyl.

PureShift 1D - Really an imaging type experiment provided for liquids NMR. Yields a
1H NMR spectrum consisting solely as a singlet at the true chemical shift for each
1H. In essence a 1H-decoupled 1H spectrum.
