******************************************************************************
aipMoveOverlay(x,y)  move selected overlay image by x,y
aipMoveOverlay(x,y,'all') move all overlay images by x,y
aipMoveOverlay:$x,$y returns offset for selected overlay image.
******************************************************************************

Argument:
	x,y are in mm, and are the offset of overlay image relative to base image.

	x,y is not cumulative, i.e., repeating aipMoveOverlay(x,y) with 
	the same x,y values displays overlay image at the same position.

	aipMoveOverlay(0,0) (or aipMoveOverlay without argument and return value)
	restores overlay to the original position.

	'all' will move overlay images in all frames.
	But if a frame has multiple overlay images, only the selected overlay 
	will be moved.

Return values:
	$x,$y are in mm, and are the offset of selected overlay image. 

	If a frame has multiple overlay images, $x,$y are the offset of 
	selected overlay image.
 
Select an overlay image:
	If only one frame is displayed and only one image is overlaid 
	on the base image, the overlay image will be automatically selected.

	But if there are multiple frames with overlaid images, or there 
	are multiple overlaid images in a frame, the following steps can be taken 
	to select an overlay image:

	1. select the frame by clicking near the frame border.
	2. select "Image" or "Color" tab to view image names in the frame. 
	3. select overlay image (if not selected yet).
