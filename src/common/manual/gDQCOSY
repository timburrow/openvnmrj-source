  - Randomization of Magnetization prior to relaxation delay
    with G-90-G (selected by sspul flag)
		
PARAMETERS

  sspul : Selects magnetization randomization option
  hsglvl: Homospoil gradient level (DAC units)
  hsgt  : Homospoil gradient time
  gzlvl1: Coherence selection gradient level
  gt1   : Gradient time
  gstab : Recovery delay
  pw    : 90 degree pulse width
  d1    : Relaxation delay
  d2    : Evolution delay
  phase : 1,2 for phase sensitive experiment
  ni    : Number of t1 increments
  sw1   : Spectral width in F1 dimension (typically same as sw)

SETUP

  - Type "gDQCOSY" or choose from Experiment menu

  - Standard setup via "wrtp" parameter uses "setgdqcosy" macro to
    determine the correct gradient length "gt1" (must be N * dwell time
    to obtain correct phase) and to set up backward linear prediction
    in F2 as well as left shift (lsfid = -1*N * dwell time). setgdqcosy
    also shifts the zero order phase by 90Â°.

  - Setup for Nano probe: "homo2D" macro calls "setnano" macro in case
    of "spintype='tach'". This sets up gradient length according to
    the spinning speed and has preferrence above setting "gt1" via the
    spectral window. With Nano probes, a compromise must be used:
    Either choose a particular spinning speed, then the spectral window
    ("sw" & "sw1") should be fixed to N * spinning speed ("spin").
    OR choose a particular spectral window, then the spinning speed
    should be fixed to N * sw.
