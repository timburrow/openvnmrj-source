h2cal			- Calculate the strength of the decoupler field
h2cal(jr1,jr2,j0)
h2cal(jr1,jr2):$gammah2,$pw90,$freq
*************************************************************************

The 'h2cal' command calculates the strength of the decoupler field.  It
uses the results from two experiments, one with the decoupler off
resonance at a lower frequency and one with the decoupler off resonance
at a higher frequency.  The frequency of the decoupler during these two
experiments, the reduced coupling constants from the two experiments
and the full coupling constant, the one that results when no decoupling
is done, are all required.

If the parameter 'dof', 'dof2','dof3', or 'dof4' is arrayed and has two
values, the command assumes these two represent the decoupler frequencies;
otherwise it will ask for the two decoupler frequencies.

The reduced coupling constants and the
full coupling constants can be entered as parameters of the 'h2cal' command.
If not entered as parameters, the command asks you for these values, too.
If no value is entered for the full coupling constant, the command assumes
a value of 142 Hz, since this is the coupling constant for dioxane, the
standard sample.

Up to three values can be returned.  The first will be the strength of the
decoupler field; the second will be the pulse width of a 90-degree pulse
from the decoupler;  the third will be the coalescence point,  that is,
the frequency at which single-frequency decoupling would collapse the
dioxane to a singlet.
