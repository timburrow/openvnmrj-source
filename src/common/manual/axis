axis     provide axis labels and scaling factors

Syntax:	 axis(domain) <: $label, $frq_scl, $scl >
         with domain set to 'fn', 'fn1', or 'fn2'

Description: The axis program requires a single argument which defines
             the axis of interest.  The keyword is the name of the
             parameter defining the Fourier number for that dimension.
             The possibilities are 'fn', 'fn1', and 'fn2'.  The program
             uses the current value of axis for that dimension and also
             checks for axis scaling using the corresponding 'scalesw',
             'scalesw1', or 'scalesw2' parameter.  The axis program will
             display or provide to the calling macro the axis label
             (e.g., 'ppm',  'kHz', 'ppm (sc)', etc),  and the divisor
             needed to convert something in units of Hz to the units
             defined by the 'axis' parameter and any scaling.  A second
             scaling factor which is solely determined by the scalesw
             type of parameter can also be returned to a macro.  This last
             scaling factor is independent of the value of the axis parameter.
             For an example of the use of the axis program,  see the rl macro.
             
Examples: axis('fn')                - display axis label and scaling
                                       along 'fn' direction
          axis('fn1'):$lab,$fr,$scl - return axis label and scaling factors
                                       along the 'fn1' direction
