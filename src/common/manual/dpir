  "dpf" displays peak frequencies,  in units specified by the "axis" parameter,
  on the graphics screen.  Only those peaks greater than "th" high are selected.
  If the interactive "ds" command was active,  this command deactivates it.

  "ppf" plots peak frequencies,  in units specified by the "axis" parameter,
  on the plotter device.  Only those peaks greater than "th" high are selected.

  "dpir" displays integral amplitudes below the appropriate spectral regions.

  "pir" plots integral amplitudes below the appropriate spectral regions.

  "dpirn" and "pirn" are equivalent to "dpir" and "pir" except that the sum of
  the integrals is normalized to the value of the parameter "ins".
