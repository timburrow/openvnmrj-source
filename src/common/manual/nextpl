nextpl:   usage  -  nextpl.

nextpl displays the 2D color map of the next 3D plane in the set
of planes defined by the VNMR parameters `plane` and `path3d`.
If nextpl immediately follows the command dproj, nextpl results
in the display of the first 3D plane within that specified set and
is therefore equivalent to the command dplane(1).  If dplane(40)
has just been executed, nextpl results in the display of 3D plane
41 of that set.  nextpl is more efficient than dplane or dproj
because the 3D parameter set (procpar3d) is not loaded into VNMR:
it is assumed to have already been loaded, e.g., by dplane or
dproj.



prevpl:   usage  -  prevpl.
 
prevpl displays the 2D color map of the previous 3D plane in the set
of planes defined by the VNMR parameters `plane` and `path3d`.
If prevpl immediately follows the command dproj, an error results
because there is no 3D plane whose number is -1.  If dplane(40) has
just been executed, prevpl results in the display of 3D plane 39 of
that set. prevpl is more efficient than dplane or dproj because the
3D parameter set (procpar3d) is not loaded into VNMR:  it is assumed
to have already been loaded, e.g., by dplane or dproj.
