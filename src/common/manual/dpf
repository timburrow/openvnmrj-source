  "dpf" displays peak frequencies,  in units specified by the "axis" parameter,
  on the graphics screen.  Only those peaks greater than "th" high are selected.
  If the interactive "ds" command was active,  this command deactivates it.

  "ppf" plots peak frequencies,  in units specified by the "axis" parameter,
  on the plotter device.  Only those peaks greater than "th" high are selected.

  A number of options are available to dpf and ppf. These include:
  'noll' which displays peak frequencies using the last previous line listing.
  'pos' which displays positive peaks only.
  'noneg' (same as 'pos').
  'top' which displays peak labels at the top of the chart.
  noisemult (numeric) which modifies the noise multiplier for noise suppression
	(see man('dll') for more information).  The default for noisemult is
	3; a larger number results in fewer peaks, a smaller number results
	in more peaks, and a value of 0.0 results in all peaks above the
	threshold.  Negative values of noisemult default to 3.  The noisemult
	arguement is inactive when the 'noll' argument is specified.

  There are two basic modes of label positioning: at the top, with long
  "leaders" extending down to the tops of the lines,  and just above each
  peak,  with short leaders.  The system defaults to the latter style.  The
  former style can be selected with the 'top' option.  The positioning can
  be further controlled for each of these modes.  In the default mode,  the
  option 'leader' followed by a number specifies the leader length in mm.
  The default is 20 mm.  In the 'top' mode,  the height of labels is changed
  by changing the parameter 'wc2'.

  "dpir" displays integral amplitudes below the appropriate spectral regions.

  "pir" plots integral amplitudes below the appropriate spectral regions.

  "dpirn" and "pirn" are equivalent to "dpir" and "pir" except that the sum of
  the integrals is normalized to the value of the parameter "ins".

Examples:
  dpf('pos')
  dpf('leader',30)
  dpf('top','noll')
  dpf('pos',0.0,'leader',30)
