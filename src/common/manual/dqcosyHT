dqcosyHT:  Hadamard DQ-COSY experiment with gradient selection of coherences.

To set up a homonuclear Hadamard DQ-COSY experiment, dqcosyHT:

  1) record a 1d H1 spectrum, ft and phase correct; 
  2) Select Setup Hadamard Encoding from Hadamard Experiments menu. Choose lb=20
     to 25 Hz and set threshold as required; 
     Use 25 Hz for the 2-ethyl-indanone sample and samples with large geminal
     couplings. 
  3) Click the "Create Line List" button and edit the created line list if 
     necessary.
  4) Select the DQ COSY experiment from the Hadamard Experiments -> 
     Use Current Parameters menu.
  5) adjust any paramaters, if necessary, e.g. pw, ni, sw1, etc.;
  5) use the Sequence button to ensure the setup is correct and then Acquire 
     to start the experiment;
  6) process with wft2da (proc1 = 'ht') or use the Process menus.

Hadamard parameters:
====================

    parameters:
    ==========
    htfrq1 - list of frequencies for Hadamard encoding.
    htbw1 - excitation bandwidth. Smaller bandwidth enhances correlations via
            long-range couplings. May also result in ROESY cross-peaks.
    ni  - number of increments. Must be a power of 2. Other allowed values 
          are n*12, n*20 and n*28, where n is a power of 2.
    htofs1 - Sets the number of increments to be omitted. Typical
            value is htofs = 1.
    pshape - shape used for Hadamard encoding, typically gaus90, square90 or
             sinc90.
    bscor - Bloch-Siegert correction for Hadamard encoding, typically set 
            bscor = 'y'.
    repflg - set repflg = 'n' to suppress Pbox reports, repflg =  'h' prints
           Hadamard matrix only.
    compH - H-1 amplifier compression factor.           
    
    optional: 
    ========     
    htss1  - stepsize for Hadamard encoding pulses. If needed, this parameter 
             can be adjusted by looking at the maximum phase increments in 
             Hadamard enconing pulses, e.g. F1_2.RF. If unsure, set htss1 = 0 
             to disable it.
    htcal1 - allows calibration of selective pulses. Set mix=0, htcal1=ni, 
         ni=0 and array htpwr1. If ni=12 (and other that are not a power of 
         two) use htcal1=8. Adjust compH so that pulse power matches the 
         optimum power found from the calibration. 

    DQ COSY Paramters:
    ==================
                sspul :         y - selects magnetization randomization option
                hsglvl:         Homospoil gradient level (DAC units)
                hsgt    :       Homospoil gradient time
                gzlvl1  :       Encoding gradient level
                gzlvl2 	:	Decoding gradient level
                gt1     :       Gradient time
                gstab   :       Recovery delay
                pw      :       First and second pulse widths
                d1      :       relaxation delay
