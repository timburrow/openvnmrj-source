 autolist - set up and start chained acquisition (M)
*****************************************************************************

      Syntax: autolist(<'auto','glide','start',>'experiment1','experiment2')

 Description: autolist sets up parameters for chained experiments by executing
	      the command strings present as arguments to the command and then 
	      starts a chained acquisition. The macro hc, hcdept, and other
              "chained" experiments set wexp equal to autolist.
	      Note: the "au" command is executed as part of the autolist macro
		    and should NOT be included in the arguments to the
                    autolist command.
              One of two optional keywords may be the first argument
              to autolist.  Without one of the keywords, the first
              argument is the current experiment and when it finishes,
              the macro procplot will be called to process the data.
              If another argument is listed, then that argument is
              executed as a command and then an au('next') is performed.
              For subsequent experiments, the text, solvent and temp are
              used from the preceding experiment.  Also, the wexp
              parameter is reset to autolist with the first experiment
              removed.  The 'auto' keyword will add the 'wait' option
              to the au call i.e., au('wait','next').  The 'glide'
              keyword will process the current data with the glidewexp
              macro instead of the procplot macro.  Typically, the
              macros which chain experiments, such as hcosy, hcapt, and
              hc, and hccorr, will start the experiment and then set
              wexp equal to autolist with its arguments being the
              list of experiments.  The 'start' keyword will cause
              the first experiment in the list as one which needs to
              be acquired rather than processed.
              

     Example: autolist('h1','c13','dept')
