SHELLSCRIPT
-----------

WTGEN allows the compilation of a user-written weighting function, which,
subsequently, can be executed from within Vnmr.  The UNIX shellscript
WTGEN can be run from within UNIX by simply typing the name of the
shellscript.  WTGEN takes the following format in a UNIX shell:


		     wtgen  filename<.c>


where the .c file extension is optional.  WTGEN performs the following
functions:


	1.	Checks for the existence of the SYSTEM bin
		directory and aborts if the directory is
		not found;

	2.	Checks for the files USRWT.O and WEIGHT.H
		in the SYSTEM bin directory and aborts if
		either of these two files cannot be found
		there;

	3.	Checks for the existence of a $vnmruser/wtlib
		directory and creates this directory if it
		does not exist;

	4.	Establishes in the $vnmruser/wtlib directory
		soft links to USRWT.O and WEIGHT.H in the
		$vnmrsystem/bin directory;

	5.	Compiles the user-written weighting function,
		which is stored in the $vnmruser/wtlib directory,
		link loads it with USRWT.O, and places the exe-
		cutable program in the same directory; any com-
		pilation and/or link loading errors are placed
		in the file "errmsg" in $vnmruser/wtlib;

	6.	Removes the soft links to USRWT.O and WEIGHT.H
		in the $vnmrsystem/bin directory.



The name of the executable program is the same as that for the
the source file without a file extension, e.g.,


		   testwt.c     ----->       testwt
		 (source file)	        (executable file)



MACRO
-----

WTGEN can also be run from within Vnmr by simply executing the macro
WTGEN.  The macro WTGEN calls the UNIX shellscript WTGEN and takes
the following format:


			wtgen('filename<.c>')



NOTE:  See also the manual entry for WTFILE.
