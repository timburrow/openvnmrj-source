 tnroesy- rotating frame NOE experiment
             OBSERVE TRANSMITTER SHOULD BE SET AT SOLVENT POSITION
             SATURATION,SPIN LOCK AND PULSES ALL USE OBS.XMTR

  Parameters:

        p1 = 90 degree pulse on protons (power level at "p1lvl")
        pw = small (30 degree) pulse on protons (active only if ratio > 0)
             if pw=0, pw is set to p1/3
     p1lvl = power level for the p1 pulse
      tpwr = power level for the spin lock pulse(s)
     ratio = tau/pw (uses cw lock if ratio is zero)
     phase = 1,2: F1 quadrature by the hypercomplex method
              (uses F1 axial peak displacement)
               3: F1 quadrature by the TPPI method
       mix = mixing time
     sspul = 'y': selects for trim(x)-trim(y) sequence at start of pulse sequence
    rocomp = 'n': no resonance offset compensation
             'y': resonance offset compensation (recommended)
  satmode  = saturation mode. Use analogously to dm, i.e. satmode='nnn' or
             satmode='ynn' or  satmode='yyn' (recommended) 
   satdly  = length of saturation during relaxation delay  
   satpwr  = power level for solvent saturation
        nt = min:  multiple of 2
             max:  multiple of 8  (recommended)
   d2corr  = empirical correction(in us) of d2 (dependent on effective field of 
             spin lock, i.e. TPWR and/or RATIO). It can be determined from the
             lp1 and sw1 values from a properly phased spectrum by the relation

                    d2corr = (lp1*1e6)/(360*sw1)

        Note that the d2corr seems to be dependent on sw1, however it
	is independent of sw1 since changes in sw1 result in corresponding
        changes in lp1 so that their ratio is constant.

        Procedure for finding d2corr(so that lp1 will = 0, giving better
             baselines in F1):
                1. Run a tnroesy experiment with d2corr set either at 0 or at a
                   value found previously. (nt and ni can be smaller, and the
                   spectrum may be transformed early to do step 2)
                2. Phase the resulting spectrum in F1. Determine lp1 and 
                   calculate d2corr from the above relationship.
                3. Add this value to the value of d2corr used in step 1.
                4. Rerun the experiment and lp1 should be close to zero.
                5. Note this value for any future experiment with the same
                   value of tpwr and ratio.

   Use of any method to make lp1=0 will result in a dc offset of F1 slices. This
   should be removed by dc2d('f1') after the 2d transform. Enough noise should 
   be left on the edges (in F1) to permit this dc correction.

NOTE: the tnroesy pulse sequence is not supplied with Mercury and GEMINI 2000.
