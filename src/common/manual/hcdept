 hcdept - Automated proton, carbon and DEPT acquisition (M)
*****************************************************************************

      Syntax: hcdept<(solvent)>

 Description: Combines the operation of the h1 and c13 macros and the DEPT
	      experiment. In non-automation mode, all spectra will be acquired
	      in the experiment in which the hcdept macro was typed. After
	      the completion of the acquisition, the command rttmp can be used
	      for further processing of the three spectra.

   Arguments: solvent is the name of the solvent. In automation mode, the enter
	      program supplies the value. In non-automation mode, the default
	      is 'cdcl3'.

    Examples: hcdept('dmso') au
