auto	-  prepare for automation run
*************************************************************************

The "auto" command prepares the automation directory for an automation
run.  The automation directory is obtained from the value of the
parameter "autodir"; or it can be entered as part of the command.
The "autodir" parameter or the argument to "auto" may be either an absolute
UNIX path name (that is,  the first character is a "/") or a relative
path name (that is,  the first character is not a "/").

If for some reason, the parameter "autodir" is not defined, you will
need to provide the location of the automation directory.  If not
given as an argument, the command will ask for the path name.

If the automation directory is not present, it will be created for
you.  All users will have full access to the directory.  The command
will abort if it fails to create this directory.

This command aborts if the spectrometer is already in automation mode.
It also aborts if you cannot write to the "conpar" file in the VNMR
system directory.
