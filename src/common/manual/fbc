fbc

The macro fbc applies 'bc' type baseline correction to all the 
spectra in an array.  The partial integral mode should be used to 
set integral regions to include all significant signals, while leaving 
as large an area of baseline as possible blank.  This minimises 
systematic errors in diffusion coefficient fits caused by baseline 
errors.
