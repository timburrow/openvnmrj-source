******************************************************************************
aipOverlayFrames('overlay'<,frameID1,frameID2,...>) overlay images in selected frames.
aipOverlayFrames('unoverlay') unoverlay images.
aipOverlayFrames('overlaid'):$ret - return whether multiple images are overlaid
aipOverlayFrames('canOverlay'):$ret - return whether more than one frame are selected
******************************************************************************

Argument:
'overlay' - overlay images in selected frames. Frames can be selected by mouse, or passing as arguments. Frame layout will be changed to 1x1. The first selected image will be displayed as the base image. Other selected image(s) will be overlaid on the base image. If the overlaid image has the same orientation as the base image (determined by Euler angles), images will be overlaid with proper scaling and translation to match the physical size and position. Otherwise the image will be overlaid without the consideration of FOV, position and data size.

'unoverlay' - unoverlay the images and return to the original frame layout.

Note, aipOverlayFrames('unoverlay') is different from aipViewLayers('remove'), which simply removes overlaid images (without changing frame layout).

'overlaid' - query whether images are overlaid as a result of aipOverlayFrames('overlay') command. Note, frame layout is changed to 1x1 temporarily and can be recoved by aipOverlayFrames('unoverlay') command. 

Note, images can be overlaid by aipRQcommand command (loading image to a frame where an image already displaed). That does not change the layout. 

aipOverlayFrames('overlaid'):$n is true only if images are overlaid by aipOverlayFrames('overlay') command. Whereas aipViewLayers('hasOverlay') is true as long as any frame has an overlaid image.

'canOverlay' - query whether images are selected to overlay. More than one image frame should be selected. Multiple frames can be selected by clicking near to boarder of the frame hwile holding ctrl key.
