******************************************************************************
ap<(template)>			-  Print out "all" parameters
pap(<template,>x,y,charsize)	-  Plot out "all" parameters
******************************************************************************

Print or plot a parameter list. In "pap", it is possible to define the
starting position on paper in mm (x direction only or x and y direction)
and to define the character size. The character size is a multiplier.
Its default is set to

  			charsize = 0.70

The string parameter "ap" normally controls the display of the commands "ap"
and "pap".  It can be modified with the command 

			paramvi('ap')

The commands "ap" and "pap" can also accept a separate template name as the
first argument (for "ap" is would be the only argument).  In this situation
the starting position arguments for "pap" become the second and third
arguments and the character size becomes the fourth argument.  Remember the
default template for both commands is "ap".

The "ap" command can accept a second argument, the name of a file to write
the parameters to. The template name must be the first argument.  For example,
ap('ap','apout') will write the ap parameters into the apout file.

Section 4.3 of the User Programming Manual describes the rules for building
a template for the "ap" and "pap" commands.
