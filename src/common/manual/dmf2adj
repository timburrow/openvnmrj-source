`dmf2adj` adjusts the parameter 'dmf2' so that the time associated
with the tip-angle resolution is an integral multiple of 100 ns.
This insures that there is no truncation error in time in the
execution of the programmable decoupling or spin-locking sequence
by the waveform generator.  The optional argument 'tipangle_resoln'
specifies the necessary tip-angle resolution for the programmable
decoupling or spin-locking sequence which is to be executed.  For
example, the tip-angle resolution for an MLEV-16 decoupling
sequence should be 90.0 degrees since every pulse in that sequence
can be represented as an integral multiple of 90.0 degrees; the
tip-angle resolution for a GARP decoupling sequence, however,
should be 1.0 degrees.

If the argument 'tipangle_resoln' is not specified when the macro
`dmf2adj` is called, the default value therefor is taken from the
parameter 'dres2'.
