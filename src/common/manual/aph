aph<(arguments):$ok,$rp,$lp>	- Automatic Phase of "rp" and "lp"
aph<('lp',arguments):$ok,$rp,$lp> - Automatic Phase of "rp" and "lp"
aph<('peakmax',arguments):$ok,$rp,$lp> - Automatic Phase of "rp" and "lp"
aph0<(arguments):$ok,$rp,$lp>	- Automatic Phase Zero-Order Term ("rp" only)
*******************************************************************************

  "aph" automatically calculates the phase parameters "lp" and "rp" required
  to produce an absorption mode spectrum.  The values of "lp" and "rp"
  calculated by "aph" do not depend on the initial values of these parameters.
  The "aph0" (aph-zero) command calculates only the "zero-order" frequency-
  independent term "rp", and does not rely on the frequency-dependent term
  "lp" being previously adjusted.  The three return values are :
	$ok - success of "aph" or "aph0" = 1 (successful) or 0 (failed)
	$rp - calculated value of "rp"
	$lp - calculated value of "lp" (aph) or current value of "lp" (aph0)
  The optional arguments are the same as those listed for the "region"
  command.

  For systems with a direct digital receiver, such as the vnmrs system,
  the correct value of lp is generally 0.0. Using aph on data collected
  by one of these systems will set lp=0.0 and optimize rp. Providing the
  'lp' argument to aph, as in aph('lp'), causes aph to optimize the lp
  parameter, rather than simply setting it to 0.0. If the 'lp' argument
  is given, it must preceed any 'select', 'ignore', or "region" arguments
  as described below. On non-direct digital receiver systems, such as the
  Inova or Mercury systems, aph and aph('lp') both optimize the lp parameter.

  The argument 'peakmax' instructs aph and aph0 to optimize the rp parameter
  to maximize the height of the largest peak. The 'lp' and 'peakmax' arguments
  must preceed any other parameters such as 'select' or 'ignore', as described below.

  aph and aph0 can select or ignore portions of the spectrum during optimization.
  For water suppressed data, the center region is often distorted and it
  could be ignored. aph and aph0 accept an 'ignore' argument followed by
  pairs of frequencies which define regions to ignore. aph and aph0 also accept
  a 'select' argument, followed by pairs of frequencies. The 'ignore' or 'select'
  argument must follow any optional "region" arguments. The 'ignore' and 'select'
  arguments can be intermixed. If the first one encountered is 'ignore', an
  implicit 'select' is done to select the entire spectrum. If the first one
  encountered is 'select', an implicit 'ignore' is done to ignore the entire
  spectrum. Some examples include:
    aph('select',10p,7p,5p,3p,'ignore',4p,4.5p)
    aph('ignore',4p,4.5p)
  Note that the order of calling 'select' and 'ignore' is important. Assume
  a spectrum from 10 ppm to 0 ppm. The following two calls are not the same.
    aph('select',8p,2p,'ignore',4.5p,5.5p)
    aph('ignore',4.5p,5.5p,'select',8p,2p)
  In the first case, an implicit 'ignore' ignores all data. The 'select'
  selects data from 8 ppm to 2 ppm. The 'ignore' ignores data from
  4.5 ppm to 5.5 ppm. The net result is that data from 8 ppm to 5.5 ppm
  and 4.5 ppm to 2 ppm are selected for phase optimization.
  In the second case, an implicit 'select' selects all data. The 'ignore'
  ignores data from 4.5 ppm to 5.5 ppm. The 'select' selects data from
  8 ppm to 2 ppm, negating the effect of the 'ignore' The net result is
  that all data from 10 ppm to 0 ppm are selected for phase optimization.

  The action of "aph" or "aph0" depends on the number of return values
  requested.  If 0 or 1 return values are requested, the parameters "rp" and
  "lp" are set to the values calculated by "aph" or "aph0".  If 2 or 3 return
  values are requested, "aph" or "aph0" returns the calculated values of "rp"
  and "lp", but does not change the values of the parameters "rp" and "lp".
