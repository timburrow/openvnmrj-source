      Syntax: reff1<(refsource1)>
              reff2<(refsource2)>

 Description: These macros use the ratio of the Xi values for the relevant
	      nuclei (as derived from "refsource1" / "refsource2" or from the
	      reference source specified in the argument) to determine the
	      reference frequency in the f1 / f2 indirect dimensions directly
	      from the reference frequency in the observe dimension, using the
	      formula
			reffrq1 = reffrq / Xi[tn] * Xi[nucf1]
			rfp1=0
			rfl1 = sw1/2 - (frq[f1] - reffrq1)*1e6
	      If the referencing in the observe dimension was determined
	      using "setref", then this method should be identical to using
	      "setref1" / "setref2" (apart from minor round-off errors).
	      HOWEVER, if the observe dimension was referenced using an
	      internal reference standard as proposed by IUPAC, then these
	      macros permit referencing ALL DIMENSIONS to that single
	      reference signal, whereas "setref1" / "setref2" would still
	      produce estimates the same way as "setref". Note that (provided
	      the sample was referenced empirically), these macros do NOT rely
	      upon a locked sample. One could probably replace "setref1" /
	      "setref2" by these macros - however, as these macros do
	      completely different things, we decided to use new names.
	      Limitations: "reff1" / "reff2" should also work on data that
	      have been recalled from an archive, or which have been acquired
	      on an other system - however, the macros fail on spectra that
	      have been referenced with VNMR releases older than VNMR 6.1C.
              If a global (or local) flag "bioref" exists and is set to 'y',
              bio-NMR referencing (based on "nuctables/nuctabrefBio") is used
              rather than standard IUPAC / organic chemistry referencing
              (based on "nuctables/nuctabref").

    Argument: If no argument is specified, the reference source is determined
	      from "refsource1" (for "reff1") or "refsource2" (for "reff2").
	      If the relevant parameter is missing, the macros try to determine
	      the (indirect) reference source from the "axis" parameter. A
	      reference source can also be specified as argument (one of
	      'sfrq', 'dfrq', 'dfrq2', 'dfrq3', or 'dfrq4').

    Examples: reff1
	      reff1('sfrq')
	      reff2('dfrq3')
