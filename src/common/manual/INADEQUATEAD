INADEQUATEAD:  Carbon-carbon connectivity using double quantum
               spectroscopy;  F1 quadrature is achieved by hardware
               small-angle phaseshifts. Options for shaped 180 pulse.

PARAMETERS

   pw       : 90 degree carbon pulse
  jcc       : carbon carbon coupling constant in hz
  phase =  0: absolute value with F1 quadrature
         1,2: hypercomplex method (phase-sensitive, F1 quadrature)
  nt = min:   multiple of   8 (phase=0)
              multiple of   4 (phase=1,2  phase=3)
       max:   multiple of 128 (phase=0)
              multiple of  64 (phase=1,2  phase=3)
  adiabatic : flag to determine whether an adiabatic refocusing 180 degrees
              pulse will be used. Strongly suggested for most cases. If set to
              'y' an adiabatic or sp26 pulse (see below) is used. If set to 'n'
              a hard 180 is used. If set to 'p' then a user supplied shaped 
              pulse is used.
  xsens     : set to 'y' if an XSens Cold Probe is used. Calculates an sp26
              constant amplitude 180 pulse which deals better with the Xsens
              peculiar power behaviour.
  adshape   : Shape file that contains the shape for the refocusing pulse,
              active only when adiabatic='p'
  adpwlvl   : Power level for the shaped refocusing pulse, active only when 
              adiabatic='p'
  adpw      : Pulse width, in usec, of the shaped refocusing pulse, active 
              only when adiabatic='p'

NOTE:  Data acquired with phase=0 should be processed with wft2d.  Data
       acquired with phase=1,2 should be processed with wft2da.
       If phase-sensitive data without F1 quadrature are desired, set phase=1
       and process with wft2da.
       For 1D spectra, set phase=1 for maximum sensitivity.
