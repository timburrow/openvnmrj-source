PARAMETERS

    BLdec   - Flag for bilevel decoupling during acquisition
    jBL     - J-coupling to be decoupled by bi-level decoupling
    nBL     - Number of high power pulses, must be a power of 2. Larger
              nBL suppresses higher order sidebands and requires more
              RF power. The default is 2.
    BLxpwr  - Extra power level for low power decoupling. This is
              added to the internal setting of the low power
              decoupling level to reduce the inner sidebands.
    BLorder - 1, Suppresses only high order sidebands; requires
                 the shortest duration of high power decoupling.
                 The sub-harmonic sidebands can be suppressed by
                 using high peak amplitude decoupling sequences,
                 such as clean-WURST or sech. The inner sidebands
                 can be suppressed by increasing the extra power
                 level, BLxpwr for the low power  decoupling.
              2, Suppresses all outer sidebands including the
                 sub-harmonic;
                 this is the DEFAULT option. The inner sidebands
                 can be reduced by increasing the extra power
                 level, BLxpwr for low power  decoupling.
              3, Suppresses all sidebands including the inner
                 sidebands; requires the longest duration of
                 high power decoupling;

Note: This setup uses explicit acquisition (dsp must be set to
      dsp = 'n') and depends on the digitization rate. As a
      result, the decoupling pulse duration depends on spectral
      width, sw. This can have some limitations, particularly
      for relatively large J-couplings and relatively small sw.
