printon  -  Direct text output to the printer
printoff<(clear'|'filename')> -  Stop sending text to the printer; start print operation
*************************************************************************

Information that is normally displayed in the text window can be sent
to a printer by entering the command ``printon''.  After entering this
command, the output from commands such as ``dg'' or ``cat'' that use
the text window will be sent to the printer (and not appear on the
VNMR screen).  The value of the parameter ``printer'' is used to
select which printer is used.

The ``printoff'' command stops this redirection of output and actually
starts the print operation.  This command MUST be entered to obtain
output on the printer.

The optional 'clear' and 'filename' arguments clear the printer file or save
the printer file to the specified filename, respectively.
