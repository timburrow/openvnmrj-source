FORMAT:		wft2dac( <mult1> , <mult2> , <mult3> , ... )

This macro allows the ready combination of 2D FID matrices within
the framework of the 2D-FT program.  The nth argument is a real number
and specifies the multiplicative coefficient for the nth 2D FID
matrix.  It currently requires that the data be acquired either
without F1 quadrature or with F1 quadrature using the TPPI method.
WFT1DAC functions in an analogous manner.  ft1dac and ft2dac work in
the same way as the wft1dac and wft2dac, respectively, except that
no weighting is performed.

USES:  E.COSY and TOCSY (with multiple mixing times)
