initialize_iterate
	Set the string 'iterate' to contain relevant parameters

Format:	initialize_iterate

	The string parameter 'iterate' is used to control which parameters will
	be iterated during a spin simulation iteration.  The macro
	initialize_iterate takes the current spin system (contained in
	'spinsys') and derives from it all relevant parameters, e.g., for an
	ABC spin system, the parameter 'iterate' will be set to
	'A,JAB,JAC,B,JBC,C'.  initialize_iterate is run by the SET PARAMS
	button in the main spin simulation menu, which will normally be
	selected at some time following the selection of the spin system.
	Of course, the parameter 'iterate' may be subsequently changed
	manually.

	For simple spin systems, iteration of all parameters is reasonable;
	for more complex spin systems, it may be desirable to alternate
	iteration of all chemical shifts with iteration of all coupling
	constants.
