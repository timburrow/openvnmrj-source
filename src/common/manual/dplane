dplane:  usage  -  dplane(<plane_type>, plane_num).

dplane displays the 2D color map of a particular data plane from
a 3D spectral data set.  `plane_type` is an optional argument and
can take only the values 'f1f2', 'f1f3', and 'f2f3'.  If `plane_type`
is specified, the VNMR parameter `plane` is updated with that new
value.  The parameter `plane` is then used to determine which type
of 2D plane is to be displayed.  `plane_num` specifies which plane of
a particular type is to be displayed.  If an F1F3 plane is to be
displayed, `plane_num` ranges from 1 to fn2/2; if an F2F3 plane is to
be displayed, `plane_num` ranges from 1 to fn1/2; and if an F1F2 plane
is to be displayed, `plane_num` ranges from 1 to fn/2.  The 3D param-
eters are loaded into VNMR each time `dplane` is executed.

For this macro, `path3d` specifies the directory (no .extr extension!)
where the 2D planes reside which have been extracted from the 3D
spectral data set.



dproj:   usage  -  dproj(<plane_type>).

dproj displays the 2D color map of the 2D projection plane from a
3D spectral data set.  The projection is a skyline projection.  The
argument `plane_type` is optional and can take only the values 'f1f2',
'f1f3', and 'f2f3'.  If `plane_type` is specified, the VNMR parameter
`plane` is updated with that new value.  The parameter `plane` is then
used to determine which type of 2D projection is to be displayed.  The
3D parameters are loaded into VNMR each time `dproj` is executed.

For this macro, `path3d` specifies the directory (no .extr extension!)
where the 2D projection resides which has been created from the 3D
spectral data set.
