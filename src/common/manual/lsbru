 lsbru - Set "lp" parameter for data from Bruker "D" series spectrometers (M)
*******************************************************************************

Syntax:		lsbru

Description:	sets the "lp" parameter value for data from any Bruker "D"
		series spectrometers (DPX, DRX, DMX, Avance), based on the
		"grpdly" (if present), or "decim" and "dspfvs" parameters.
		Setting "lp" is preferable over setting just "lsfid" because
		 - "lp" corresponds to a circular data shift, i.e., does
		   not discard data points, as opposed to "lsfid";
		 - some newer Bruker DSP algorithms require fractional
		   shifts, i.e., "lp" needs to be adjusted in any case.
		"lsbru" can be called on any dataset, as it only alters
		"lp" if the "decim" and "dspfvs" parameters exist.
		The calculated value of "lp" should allow phasing the
		spectrum with "rp" (zero-order phase correction) and minor
		additional first-order corrections ("lp") only.
		Note that some "lp" settings for older data sets are
		estimations only and may require larger corrections, still.
		This macro is based on information that was received via
		Internet and was originally collected by W.M.Westler; the
		current version was assembled using information provided by
                Virginia W. Miner, Acorn NMR Inc. (via AMMRL, 2006-03-30),
		Juan Carlos Cobas, Univ. de Santiago de Compostela, Spain,
		originally collected by W.M. Westler and F. Abildgaard,
		NMRFAM, University of Wisconsin-Madison (1996).
