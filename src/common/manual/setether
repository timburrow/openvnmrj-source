SETETHER is a UNIX shellscript designed to either connect or
re-connect the Host Computer System to the Ethernet network.
Only Superuser (ROOT) can execute this shellscript properly.
If the system is already connected to the ethernet network,
SETETHER does nothing.

SunOS:
    If there is not already a `hosts.ether' file, SETETHER
    creates a template `hosts' file which readily allows the
    user to add in more system ethernet addresses.  If there
    is already a `hosts.ether' file, SETETHER copies it to
    `hosts'.  It also restores the `hostname.le0' file so
    that ethernet is activated on the Host Computer System
    when UNIX is rebooted.


Solaris:
    SETETHER undoes the work of SETNOETHER.  You cannot use
    the SETETHER command unless you previously entered
    SETNOETHER.  It restores the `hostname.le0',
    `defaultdomain' and `defaultrouter' so that ethernet is
    activated on the Host Computer System when UNIX is
    rebooted.
