 mref  -  Set Referencing Based on Other Spectrum from the Same Sample (M)
*******************************************************************************

      Syntax: mref(<source_exp,>target_exp)<:$ret>
	      mref(source_fid)<:$ret>

 Description: Assume you have measured a spectrum (typically a 1H spectrum)
	      and referenced it on the signal from an internal reference (such
	      as TMS, see the IUPAC recommendations). Now you join a different
	      experiment and measure a second spectrum on a different nucleus.
	      To reference this spectrum, you don't need to add a (secondary)
	      reference compound, but you can use "mref" to PROPERLY reference
	      this spectrum, based on the reference signal in the first
	      spectrums, using the Xi values from the IUPAC recommendations.
	      The primary requirement for "mref" to work is that the sample
	      must be AT THE SAME TEMPERATURE AND LOCKED ON THE SAME SIGNAL
	      for the two acquisitions (reference source and target). With nD
	      experiments, "mref" only references the observe dimension. The
	      indirect dimensions can be referenced using "reff1" and "reff2"
	      (after using "mref" or after manual referencing of the observe
	      dimension). The reference frequency "reffrq" is calculated as
	      follows:
		    reffrq_b = reffrq_a / Xi_a * Xi_b
	      "mref" also corrects for possible changes in the lock frequency:
		    reffrq_b = reffrq_b / lockfreq_a * lockfreq_b
	      This means that "mref" works even if the lock frequency changed
	      between the two acquisitions, or even if the two spectra were
	      acquired on different instruments, maybe even at different field
	      strengths.
	      Once "reffrq" is calculated, "mref" calculates "rfl" and "rfp":
		    rfp = 0
		    rfl = sw/2 - (sfrq - reffrq)*1e6
	      Note that "mref" can only track lock frequency changes if the
	      systemglobal parameters "lockfreq" and "h1freq" have been saved
	      in the local parameters at "go" time, through "saveglobal",
	      i.e., if both data sets were acquired under VNMR 6.1C or later.
	      With earlier data, "mref" can only work if a) both data sets
	      were acquired at the same lock frequency (on the same
	      instrument), and if (on a datastation) the parameters "lockfreq"
	      and (on older instruments) "h1freq" are set to the values used
	      to acquire the data.
	      "mref" reports the referencing action on line 3. If you want to
	      suppress, you can call it with a return argument, e.g.:
		    $ret='' mref('myfid.fid'):$ret
	      In this case, the referencing message is captured in the return
	      argument "$ret" (you could use the contents of this string
	      variable to label plots with the referencing information).
	      If a global (or local) flag "bioref" exists and is set to 'y',
	      bio-NMR referencing (based on "nuctables/nuctabrefBio") is used
	      rather than standard IUPAC / organic chemistry referencing
	      (based on "nuctables/nuctabref").

   Arguments: If one numeric argument is specified, the referencing is
	      transferred FROM THE CURRENT EXPERIMENT to the specified one.
	      If two numeric arguments are given, the first argument indicates
	      the reference source, the second one the reference target (i.e.,
	      the experiment in which the referencing is set by "mref").
	      Alternatively, the name of a FID file (with or without
	      extension) can be given as (single) argument; in this case, the
	      data in the CURRENT experiment are referenced based on the
	      referencing in the specified FID file.

    Examples: mref(3)
	      mref(1,2)
	      mref('myfid')
	      mref('/data/fids/myfid.fid')
