expl 	Display Exponential/Polynomial Curves
pexpl	Plot Curves

	Format:	 	<p>expl<(option,line#,line#)>
        Description:	Display or plot exponential curves resulting from
			T1, T2, or Kinetics analysis.  Display or plot of 
			Polynomial Curves from Diffusion or other type of 
			analysis. No argument displays first 8 curves if that 
			many along with the data points.  Otherwise selected 
			curves are plotted.
        		sc, wc, sc2, and wc2 control the size of plot.

        Options:	'regression' signifies the beginning of generalized 
			curve fitting.  Expl displays the data in 
			'regression.inp' as unconnected points, and also uses 
			'regression.inp' to create the file 'analyze.inp',
			which serves as input to 'analyze' for curve fitting.

                        'linear', 'square', 'log' provide for plotting of the
			data points against the square or log of the data. 
			The first keyword controls x-axis scale,  the second
                        keyword controls the y-axis.
			Default is to 'linear'.
			
			'link' causes the data points to be connected rather
			than a plot of the theoretical curve.

			'nocurve' produces a plot of data points only.

			'tinysymbol' produces a plot with small-scale data
			point symbols.

			'nosymbol' produces a plot of the curve only.

			'noclear' does not erase the graphics screen before
                        drawing the plot.

			'oldbox' is used to plot an additional curve on an
			existing plot.  Only the first data set in analyze.out
			is plotted.  It causes the program to get box and scale
			description from expl.out in the current experiment.
                        When the 'oldbox' option is used, a required second 
			argument identifies the curve number and data point 
			symbol which will be used to represent the data.  This 
			second argument is a number from 1 to 8.

			'file' followed by a filename replaces analyze.out as
			the input to expl.

	        Files: 	'analyze.out' file is the data input file except 
			for regression when it is 'regression.inp'.
			'expl.out' saves certain display/plot parameters.

			See 'expl in the Commands Manual for the file format 
			of 'analyze.out'.

	 		Format for regression input, 'regression.inp': 

			Text Line (Optional)
			Second text line (Optional) displayed along Y scale
				nsets 	npairs
  			<NEXT> 
	  			x y   		(first set, first pair)		
	  			x y   		(first set, second pair)
	  			......	

  			<NEXT> 
	  			x y   		(second set, first pair)	
	  			......

			The optional text lines must not begin with a digit.

	 		The line beginning with 'NEXT' is inserted at the 
			start of each data set when the number of pairs per 
			peak is variable.  In this case, set 'nsets' and 
			'npairs' to 0.

			Limits: 2048 points maximum from a data set.
			        2048 points maximum from all sets 
					displayed/plotted.
				8 data sets maximum displayed/plotted.
			        128 data sets maximum are read.

	     Examples:  expl	
				- display from the first up to the sixth
				  curve with data points from 'analyze.out'
			expl(1,3,6)
				- display curves with indexes 1, 3, and 6
				  from 'analyze.out' with data points
			pexpl(1,3,6)
				- plot the data
			expl('regression') 
				- display the data in the first up to the
				  sixth data set in 'regression.inp'
			expl('regression',4,5)
				- display the data in the fourth and the
				  fifth data set in 'regression.inp'
