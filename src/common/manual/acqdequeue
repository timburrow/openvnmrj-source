***********************************************************
acqdequeue<:$ret>            -  dequeue acquisition from current experiment
acqdequeue<('go_id')><:$ret> -  dequeue an acquisition
***********************************************************
   When a go, ga, or au command is issued, instructions are sent
   to the acquisition system to run that experiment. If another
   experiment is already running, the request is queued. When the
   prior experiment finishes, the queued acquisition will start.
   The acqdequeue command will remove an experiment from this queue.
   The acqdequeue command will not stop an experiment that is already
   started. An optional return argument will be set to 1 if the
   experiment is successfully dequeued; otherwise it will be set to 0.

   When a go, ga, or au command is issued, a unique identifier is added
   to the parameter set, in the processed tree. This parameter is
   named 'go_id'. This parameter can be used as an argument for the
   acqdequeue command.  If no argument is given, the value of this
   parameter in the current experiment's processed tree is used.
