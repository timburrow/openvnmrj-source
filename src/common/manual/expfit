*****************************************************************************
expfit  Unix program for making a least squares fit to a polynomial 
	or exponential curve.
*****************************************************************************

        Syntax:	expfit option(s) <analyze.inp  >analyze.list

   Description: The program expfit does a least-squares curve fitting to
		the data supplied in 'analyze.inp'. Macros are available
		for the specialized uses of analyze such as 't1' and 'kinetics'.
		They avoid the need for the user to select options and get 
		the correct file format.
		In the regression mode, the type of curve fitting, 
		('poly1',...) must be selected.  For regression 
		(generalized curve fitting), the regression section in 
		the Operation Manual gives the input file format and 
		describes the menus that permit options choices 
		indirectly through menu buttons.  

	Files:	The text file analyze.inp which for t1, T2, kinetics,
			 contact_time, and regression, contains:
	  	<optional descriptive text line>				
	  	<optional y-axis title - regression only>			
	  	number of peaks(data sets)   number of (x,y) pairs per peak		
			and, regression only, x scale type   y scale type
		<NEXT  	number of (x,y) pairs for this peak > 
		peak index    
	  	x y   (first peak,first pair)					
	  	x y   (first peak,second pair)				
	  	......	
		<NEXT  	number of (x,y) pairs for this peak > 
		peak index    
	  	x y   (second peak, first pair)	
	  	......

  		In the regression mode the line beginning with
  		'NEXT' is inserted at the start of each data set 
  		when the number of pairs per peak is variable.
  		In this case the header contains the maximum number 
  		of pairs per peak.
	        For T1, T2, kinetics, and contact_time, information from the 
		file 'fp.out' and from the array 'xarray' are used to 
		construct this file, therefore, it is necessary to run 
		'fp' prior to 'analyze'.  For regression, this file is 
		made by running "expl('regression')".
   	        For 'diffusion', 'contact_time', and, if not in regression
		mode, poly1 and poly2, it is slightly different:	

	  	List of <number> x-y data pairs	 (6 strings)
	  	<Descriptive text line>					
	  	<X-values>  	<Y-values>	 (2 strings without blanks)	
	  	x y   (first peak,first pair)	 (continues as above)		

		'expfit' also makes a file 'analyze.out', which is used
		by 'expl' to display the results of the analysis in 
		addition to output to the standard output which is
		usually directed to 'analyze.list'.

       Options:	The following options are implemented in 'analyze':

		    T1		Perform T1 analysis (default)
		    T2		Perform T2 analysis
		    kinetics    Perform kinetics analysis
					decreasing peak height
		    increment   Perform kinetics analysis with
					increasing peak height
		    list	Extended listing for each peak
		    diffusion   A special analysis for diffusion experiments
		    contact_time A special analysis for solids cross-
					polarization spin-lock experiments
		    regression  Sets regression mode, signifies generalized
					curve fitting with choices
					poly1, poly2, poly3, and exp
		    poly0	With regression, calculates mean
		    poly1	With regression, a linear fitting
		    poly2	With regression, a quadratic fitting
		    poly3	With regression, a cubic curve fitting
		    exp		With regression, an exponential curve fitting


      Examples: expfit d2 T1 list <analyze.inp >analyze.out
                expfit regression exp list <analyze.inp >analyze.out
