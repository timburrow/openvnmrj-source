`wftt3` allows F3 processing of 3D data to be performed
concurrently with data acquisition.  To invoke this function,
set wnt='wftt3' and use `au` to start the acquisition of the
3D data.  When `wftt3` detects that all the FID's comprising
a (t1,t2) block have been acquired, it starts up the ft3d
program in background to process that block of FID's in F3.

The 3D processing information file, created by typing `set3dproc`
within VNMR, does not need to contain valid F1 and F2 processing
information but only valid F3 processing information.  Once the
F3 processing is complete, a new 3D information file can be
created for the F1-F2 processing stages which contains valid
F1 and F2 processing information.

The non-standard VNMR string parameter 'path3d' can be used to
specify the directory into which the F3 processed 3D data is
to be stored.  Normally, 'path3d' is absent in the parameter
set.  If this is the case or if path3d = '', the F3 processed
3D data is stored in the directory curexp/datadir3d.

The parameter 'path3d' can be created by issuing the following
commands within VNMR:

		create('path3d','string')
		setgroup('path3d','display')
