th2d :

This parameter is used by ll2d when determining the bounds of a peak
and calculating its volume.  It can take a value between 0.0 and 1.0.
If th2d is set to 1.0, ll2d integrates all points in the peak which
are above the current threshold for the spectrum (that is, the portion
of the peak which can be seen in a contour plot of the spectrum).
A smaller value of th2d will cause ll2d to integrate a larger area
when determining the volume of a peak.  If th2d is 0.5, for example,
ll2d will integrate all points in a peak which are above 0.5 times
the current threshold.


diagth2d :

This parameter is used by ll2d to exclude diagonal peaks when peak
picking.  Peaks within diagth2d Hertz of the diagonal will not be picked
by ll2d.  Setting diagth2d to 0.0 will cause ll2d to pick all peaks
including diagonal peaks.
