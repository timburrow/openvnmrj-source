******************************************************************************
lp<(name/path<,'rlp'>)> - Perform linear prediction (LP) to extend current fid data. 
******************************************************************************

By default the new fid will be saved as curexp+’/lp.fid’.
lp($fullpath) will write the new fid to the given path, and lp($name) will write it to curexp with the given name.

'rlp' - keyword to perform LP on real fid data.

lp command uses current LP parameters. But it does not use proc (which can be left as proc='ft').

lp will take lsfid into account. If lsfid<0 (right shift), more points will be generated backward. In order not to lose points forward, fn should be bigger than np. 

lp command does not do zero filling. bigger fn value allows forward LP or right shift fid.
