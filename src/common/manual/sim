sim -  Sample in magnet  (For systems equipped with a robot)
************************************************************

The sim macro generates a pop-up window to set the number of the
sample currently in the magnet. The sim macro is only available for
systems with a robot.  This macro would typically be used
only after a manual insert of a sample.  In this case, the NMR console
is unaware of the proper location of the inserted sample.
The sim macro allows a location to be assigned to the inserted
sample.
In addition to assigning the number of the sample in the magnet,
the "Sample in Magnet" popup can also be used to remove the current
sample or to replace the current sample.
