 Syntax: writetrace<(traceno)>
         writexy<(traceno)>
         writejxy<(traceno)>

 Description: "writetrace" creates an ASCII file from a phasefile trace in
	      the current experiment. The argument indicates the number
	      of the trace that is to be "asciified". The trace orientation
	      depends on the orientation of the current data set (trace
	      parameter). "writetrace" works on fids (1D, arrayed, 2D),
	      interferograms and 1D/2D spectra. Trace counting starts at 1.
	      The default trace is the current one. The output will be written
	      into a file in the current experiment, using the trace number as
	      filename extension:
		curexp+'/trace.1'	1D spectrum (can be 1st of an array)
		curexp+'/trace.8'	8th trace from arrayed 1D data set
		curexp+'/f2trace.13'	13th f2 trace from 2D data set
		curexp+'/f1trace.1024'	1024th f1 trace from 2D data set

	      NOTE: the data MUST have been displayed using the "ds" (1D) or
	      "dcon" or related (2D) commands, otherwise the phased spectrum
	      is not even generated, and "writetrace" can't work. For 2D data,
	      also traces that are currently not on display must have been
	      displayed in the current orientation once before, otherwise
	      they may not exist in phasefile!

	      "writexy" does the same thing as "writetrace", except that it
	      creates an output file with x and y pairs (one pair per line,
   	      x values in referenced Hz). Also here, the output will be
	      written into a file in the current experiment, using the trace
	      number as filename extension:
		curexp+'/xytrace.1'	  1D spectrum (can be 1st of array)
		curexp+'/xytrace.8'	  8th trace from arrayed 1D data set
		curexp+'/f2xytrace.13'	  13th f2 trace from 2D data set
		curexp+'/f1xytrace.1024'  1024th f1 trace from 2D data set

              "writejxy" does almost the same as "writexy", but in a mode that
	      is adjusted for calls by the "svxyj" macro (JCAMP-DX X,Y data
	      conversion).

 Examples: writetrace
	   writetrace(13)
	   writetrace(1024)
	   writexy
	   writexy(13)
