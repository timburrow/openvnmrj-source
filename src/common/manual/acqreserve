acqreserve             - Reserve the acquisition console for the current owner
******************************************************************************

acqreserve controls reservation of the NMR acquisition console, allowing a
user sole access.  It reserves the console for the current user, as specified
by the owner parameter.  This user / owner will have access to the acquisition
commands to acquire data, lock, shim, set temperature, etc.

If the console is reserved, any VnmrJ session with a different user / owner
will be forced into a datastation mode.  Access to acquisition related commands
and acquisition related panels will be prevented in this datastation mode.

Any background processing will not be subject to acqreserve restrictions.
That is, automation and other background processing, such as processing
associated with wexp or werr processing, will continue even if the console
is reserved by someone else.

acqreserve takes up to three optional arguments. The first argument is 'on',
'off', or 'autooff'. If no argument is given, the default is 'on'.
acqreserve('on') makes the reservation.  acqreserve('off') removes the
reservation.  acqreserve('autooff') is described below.  The other
optional arguments are 'noAutoOff' and 'force'. They can be provided in
either order, following the 'on', 'off', or 'autooff' argument.

By default, a console reservation will be removed when the user / owner exits
from the current VnmrJ session. Using the acqreserve('on','noAutoOff') option
causes the reservation to remain intact, even after the user / owner exits.
For example, they will maintain the console reservation while they travel and
start a new session at a remote site. If they do not exit from the first VnmrJ
session and start a second session somewhere else, that second session will
share the reservation.  The reservation does not need to be turned off from
the VnmrJ that started it. The capitalization in the second argument is ignored.
The argument 'noautooff' also works. The invocation acqreserve('autooff') is
used when the user exits. This will turn off the reservation, as long as it
was not turned on with the 'noAutoOff' option.

A force option will turn the reservation on or off, even if the current
user / owner is not the one that made the original reservation. A record
will be kept of forced reservation events.  

If acqreserve is never used, or after acqreserve('off') is issued, access
to the console will be available on a first come first served basis. As soon
as the console becomes "Idle", any user not in datastation mode will be able
to access it.
