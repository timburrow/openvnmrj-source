      Syntax: integrate

 Description: "integrate" was designed as a "universal" macro for selecting
	      integral regions and/or adjust the integrals in size and offset.
	      Only if regions are not already selected, and if intmod is set
	      to 'partial', "integrate" will call "region" to select the
	      integral regions. For proton spectra this is done through the
	      "hregions" macro; for F19 and P31 spectra (wide spectral windows,
	      multiplet spectra), "region" is called with optimized arguments,
	      and for other nuclei (mostly decoupled, single line spectra)
	      other, also optimized parameters are used with the "region"
	      command (such that lines consisting of a few datapoints only
	      and also recognized).
