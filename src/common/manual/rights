rights('right'<,'errval'>) -  determine if an operator has the specified right
cmdlineOK(<'errval'>)      -  determine if an operator has a command line
*******************************************************************************

  The rights program queries the "rights" database to determine if the
  current operator has the specified right. This command is not typically
  used directly by an operator. It is used by the interface designer to
  determine if and how certain options should be presented.

  The VnmrJ administrator interface is used to grant operators rights.
  If this has not been done, the rights command will grant any requested
  right. If a right is requested that is not in the rights database,
  that right will be granted.

  Granting a right means that the rights program will return a 1 to the
  calling macro.  In the example below, $ok will be set to 1 if the
  prioritySample right is granted.  It will be set to 0 if not granted.

  rights('prioritySample'):$ok

  An optional second argument can be provided.  This will be the return
  value if the right is not granted. For example,

  rights('prioritySample',-1):$ok

  will set $ok to -1 if the prioritySample right is not granted. This can be
  used by the interface designed so that a button may be either "grayed out"
  of removed if the right is not granted.

  The rights can contain any alphanumeric character. There can be capital
  letters to improve readability, but the comparison is always
  case-insensitive.  The rights prioritySample, PrioritySample, and
  prioritysample all refer to the same right.

  The cmdlineOK program queries whether the current operator has the
  command line enabled. This command is not typically used directly
  by an operator. It is used by the interface designer to
  determine if and how certain options should be presented.

  The VnmrJ administrator interface is used to grant access to the command line.

  If the operator has access to the command line, the cmdlineOK program
  will return a 1 to the calling macro.  In the example below, $ok will
  be set to 1. It will be set to 0 if the command line is not available.

  cmdlineOK:$ok

  An optional argument can be provided.  This will be the return
  value if command line access is not granted. For example,

  cmdlineOK(-1):$ok

  will set $ok to -1 if command line access is not granted. This can be
  used by the interface designed so that a button may be either "grayed out"
  of removed if command line access is not granted.
