 plarray - Plotting macro for arrayed 1D spectra (M)
*****************************************************************************

      Syntax: plarray

 Description: plarray is a "generic" macro for plotting arrayed 1D spectra.
	      plarray is called by the "plot" macro, but can also be used "by
	      hand".
              For the plot layout "procarray" distinguishes between arrays
              with few elements (6 or less), which will be stacked vertically
              (no horizontal offset), and spectra with many (over 6) elements.
              Those are stacked horizontally by default, unless there are too
              many lines, in which case a diagonally stacked display is chosen.
              Horizontal stacking is mostly adequate for pulse and power cali-
              brations, where there are usually few lines only; diagonally
              stacked displays/plots are frequently chosen for T1/T2 experi-
              ments on entire spectra, often with many lines.
              The automatic stacking mode can be overridden by creating and
              setting a string parameter "stackmode" in the startup macro, or
              before calling "procplot" or "procarray". Possible values for
              "stackmode" are 'horizontal','vertical', or 'diagonal'.
              "dept" type spectra can in principle also be processed with
              "procarray", but of course no dept editing will occur.
