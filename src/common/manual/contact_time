" contact_time  -  MAS cross-polarization spin-lock contact time analysis  "
" ************************************************************************ "

    This macro is used to process data obtained using 
    an array of values for a pulse-length parameter. 
    It runs "expfit" which does an exponential curve fitting 
    that determines the value of T1 and T2.

    The output is matched to the equation

    	I = [S_inf - (S_inf - S0) * EXP(-T/Tch)] * EXP(-T/Tlrho) +  S0

    Tch is the time constant of a spin-locked cross-polarization process.
    Tlrho is the relaxation time of 13C polarization in the proton
     	rotating field.
    The required input is the file 'fp.out' from 'fp' and the values of
    the arrayed parameter.

    The output table is the file 'analyze.list' in the current experiment.
    The file 'analyze.out' is used by 'expl' to display the results.
    
    The following steps may be used in processing the experiment: 
    	1. Type: wft dssh
    	2. Type: full ds aph
    	3. Click Next on the menu, then Thresh; use left mouse
    	   button to set threshold
    	4. Type: dll fp
    	5  Type: contact_time 
    	6. If desired, adjust 'sc', 'wc', 'sc2', and 'wc2' by 
    	   typing 'center' or 'full'
    	7. Type: expl
