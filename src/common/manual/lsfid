All six of these parameters are in the processing group.  phfid, lsfid,
and lsfrq operate on complex "np" FID data, referred to as the t2 dimen-
sion in a 2D experiment or as the t3 dimension in a 3D experiment.  The
parameters phfid1, lsfid1, and lsfrq1 operate on "ni" interferogram data,
both hypercomplex and complex.  "ni" interferogram data are referred to
as the t1 dimension in both a 2D and a 3D experiment.  phfid2, lsfid2,
and lsfrq2 operate on "ni2" interferogram data, both hypercomplex and
complex.  "ni2" interferogram data are referred to as the t2 dimension
in a 3D experiment.  All six of these parameters are properly handled
by a WTI operation (display), i.e., a WTI operation on an "ni" inter-
ferogram applies the parameters phfid1, lsfid1, and lsfrq1, if selected,
to the time-domain data prior to the Fourier transformation.

phfid, phfid1, and phfid2 can take values from -360.0 to +360.0 and spec-
ify the angle of zero-order rotation in degrees.  This zero-order rotation
is executed as a part of retrieving the time-domain data into the active
region of the VNMR memory and can be used instead of "rp" (phfid), "rp1"
"rp1" (phfid1), or "rp2" (phfid2) applied to the frequency-domain data.
lsfrq, lsfrq1, and lsfrq2 are the time-domain equivalents of "lp", "lp1",
and "lp2" within VNMR and result in a frequency shift of the spectral data.
phfid is used only in a complex phase rotation; phfid1 and phfid2 are
used in a complex phase rotation for complex t1/t2 interferograms and in
a hypercomplex phase rotation for hypercomplex t1/t2 interferograms.

lsfid can take values from -fn/2 to np/2 (or -fn/2 to fn/2 if fn < np)
and specifies the number of complex points (not real points) that the
"np" FID is to be either left-shifted (lsfid > 0) or right-shifted (lsfid
< 0).  lsfid1 can take values from -fn1/2 to ni (or -fn1/2 to fn1/2 if
fn1 < 2*ni) and specifies the number of hypercomplex (for hypercomplex
interferogram data) or complex (for complex interferogram data) points
that the "ni" interferogram is to be either left-shifted (lsfid1 > 0) or
right-shifted (lsfid1 < 0).  lsfid2 can take values from -fn2/2 to ni2
(or -fn2/2 to fn2/2 if fn2 < 2*ni2) and specifies the number of hypercom-
plex (for hypercomplex interferogram data) or complex (for complex inter-
ferogram data) points that the "ni2" interferogram is to be either left-
shifted (lsfid2  > 0) or right-shifted (lsfid2 < 0).

lsfrq, lsfrq1, and lsfrq2 can in principle take any real value, either
positive or negative.  A negative value results in peaks being shifted
upfield (to the right); a positive value, in peaks being shifted down-
field (to the left).  These 3 parameters store the value of the frequency
shift in Hz.
