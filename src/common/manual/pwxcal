Technique:	The pulse sequence "pwxcal" is used for determining the
                pulse width characteristics of the probe's decoupler
                channel[s] in indirect or triple resonance experiments.
                The pulse sequence can also be used for determining
                the RF field homogeneity of the decoupler.

                The parameter pwx1 is arrayed to calibrate the 90 degree pulse
                width on the first decoupler.  If a second decoupler is present,
                the parameter pwx2 is arrayed to calibrate the 90 degree pulse
                width on that decoupler.  If a third decoupler is present,
                the parameter pwx3 is arrayed to calibrate the 90 degree pulse
                width on that decoupler.

                The pwxcal macro provides an interactive method of
                selecting the decoupler to calibrate and the nucleus
                (C13, N15, or P31) to calibrate.

NOTE: the pwxcal pulse sequence is not supplied with Mercury and GEMINI 2000.
