******************************************************************************
aipOverlayGroup(imgPath) - automatically overlay a group of images, specified by
	imgPath, on another group that are currently displayed.
******************************************************************************

"imgPath" is a full path containing 2D or 3D image data to be overlaid on 
currently displayed images according to their orientation and slice position
Base images can be a 2D scan or 2D planes extracted from a 3D scan.

Dragging a scan to the canvas while holding ctrl key (ctrl/dragging) will 
overlay the scan on displayed images (execute aipOverlayGroup(imgPath)).

Overlaid images can removed by "Remove Overlay" button in RQ, or by 
command aipViewLayers('remove'). 

Overlay 2D images:

	The orientation and slice position of the base image and an image in 
	imgPath will be used to determine whether the two images overlay. 
	If a image does not co-plane with any base image, it will not be overlaid.

	The criteria for two images to co-plane is that they have the same 
	orientation and their z position (pss) is within a limit specified by 
	parameter aipOverlayThk[1]. The default value is 2.0 mm.

	The x,y position of overlay image will be automatically aligned with 
	the base image.

	The overlay image and base image may have different FOV and resolution.

	More than one group of images can be overlaid on base images.

Overlay 3D data on 2D images:

        The orientation and slice position of the base images will be used to
	extract image planes from the 3D data, and the extracted planes will be
	overlaid respectively on the base images.

	The thickness of the overlay is determined by parameter aipOverlayThk[2]. 
	The default value is 1.5, which represents 1.5 times of the voxel size 
	in z dimension.

Overlay 3D data on orthogonal planes:

	When double clicking a 3D scan, 3 orthogonal planes of the 3D image, 
	specified by rotation angles and slice positions, will be displayed.

	Ctrl/dragging another 3D data over the extracted planes will result in 
	the same planes extracted from the second 3D data and overlay on the 
	planes extracted from the first 3D data. 

	A third or four 3D data etc... can be dragged to overlay (if computer 
	memory allows).

	Overlaid 3D data will remain in memory until double clicking a scan 
	(to clear the memory and display only that scan).	
 
Known issues:

	A bit of slow when overlay more than a few images.

	Image overlay relies on the header info of base image to determine which 
	image to overlay or which planes to extract. If base image does not have
	correctly header info, wrong image will be extracted/overlaid.
