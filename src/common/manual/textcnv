unix_vxr( <unix text file>,    <file in VXR format> )
vxr_unix( <file in VXR format>,<unix text file> )
**************************************************************************

These two commands provide compatibility with TEXT FILES ONLY obtained from
XL or VXR systems, either via magnetic tape or Ethernet.  Each accepts two
arguments.  With both commands, the first argument is the input file an
must be preset.  Both commands use the second argument as the output file,
which will either be created or if pre-existing, truncated.

Never use vxr_unix with files other than text files obtained from a VXR
style system.

The output file cannot be identical to the input file.  This is checked for,
and if true, produces an error.

The vxr_unix command may be used IN VNMR ONLY with one argument.  The text
will be displayed in the scrolling buffer.
