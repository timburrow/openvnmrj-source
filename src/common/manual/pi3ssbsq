pi3ssbsq - sets up pi/3 shifted sine-bell squared window function 
		in 1, 2 or 3 dimensions.

usage   :   pi3ssbsq(<# of t1 inc>,<# of t2 inc>)

	By default the # of t1 increments is set to ni 
		       # of t2 increments is set to ni2

The macro automatically checks whether the data is 1D, 2D and 3D.
