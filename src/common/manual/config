config -    Display current configuration, and possibly change it
********************************************************************

The "config" command displays the current configuration.  If the
console is in use and the user has write access to:
    the system global parameter file,
    the link "stdpar" in the VNMR system directory,
    the file that link points to,
    the link "tests" in the VNMR system directory,
    the file that link points to AND
    the VNMR system directory itself,
the configuration can be changed.  In this situation, a window
will appear on top of the VNMR windows.  The single argument
'display' will PREVENT the interactive mode from operating.

Usually, the VNMR system manager will configure the system once, and
the set the protection on the parameter file to permit read access
only by other users.

In interactive mode, a separate panel appears.  In non-interactive mode,
the current choices are displayed in the text window. See the
installation manual for details on the choices.
