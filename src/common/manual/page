page<'clear'|'filename')> - submit plot and change plotter page
******************************************************************************

Submits the current plotter file, which has been created by all previous plotter
commands, and changes the paper after the plot has been completed. The page macro
does this by calling the plotpage command. Actual plotting is controlled by the
vnmrplot script in the bin subdirectory of the VNMR system directory.

Different types of plotters require different plot handling.  The page macro
determines if any special handling is required and performs that handling as
needed.  DICOM plotting is an example of special handling.

The page macro can also clear the current plotter file or save the data to
a specified file name.

'clear' is a keyword to clear the plot made thus far; that is, clear the data in
the current plotter file.

file is the name of a file to save the plot for import into a document. If the file
already exists, it is overwritten.
