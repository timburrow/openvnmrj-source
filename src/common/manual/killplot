************************************************************

This macro kills and removes all current plot jobs in the plot
queue for the active plotter in Vnmr.  Unless the user execut-
ing this macro is root (superuser), only that user's plot jobs
will be deleted from the plot queue.

It is remotely possible that the plotter may have to be re-
initialized after the execution of this macro.  Re-initialization
is accomplished by turning the plotter off and then turning it
back on after a few seconds.  HP pen plotters appear to be more
susceptible to this problem than the other HP output devices
supported by Vnmr.

If one port has been configured to be both a printer and a plotter,
killplot can cause both plot AND print jobs to that port to be
deleted.  As an example, if printer = 'LaserJet_300' and plotter =
'LaserJet_300R' and if one has typed "pl pscale page" followed by
"ptext(vnmruser+'/psglib/noesy.c')", killplot will delete both
jobs despite the fact that the former is a plot job and the latter,
a print job.
