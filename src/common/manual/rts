  "svs('filename')" saves all shim coil settings except z0.

  If the filename is a relative path, the SVS command uses the applications
  directories to decide where to save the shims.  It will save them in the
  first one it finds where it has write permissions.

  If the filename is an absolute path, the SVS command uses it with no
  modifications.

  The SVS command reports where it stored the shims, unless it is requested
  to return the status, as described below.

  The default is the system prompts for a file name. You are
  warned if you attempt to overwrite a parameter set that already exists.
  If the 'force' option is given, you will not be warned.  The older shim
  set will be removed.

  "rts" works in a similar fashion, but uses the above process to locate a
  preexisting file of shim settings.  The shim coil settings are copied
  into the current parameter set of the current experiment.  The RTS command
  reports where it found the shims, unless it is requested to return the
  status, as described below.

  The RTS command will return shims from a FID file or a PAR file, selecting
  the shim parameters from the parameters stored there.

  Either command will return the status of its operation.  Possible values
  and their meaning:

      0        failed to store/find shim file
      1        found/stored shims, either as an absolute path or in the
               shims directory of the first application directory.
      >=2      found/stored shims in the shims directory of the second,
               third, or later application directory.

  If a return value is requested, the svs and rts will not display any information.
