gHMQC: Gradient selected phase-sensitive gHMQC

See the J1CHTab and HMQC entries for general information.

The lower case g denotes this sequence as one which uses PFG gradients to select the
desired coherence. The parameter EDratio (from probe file) tells the sequence how
to scale the encode and decode PFG gradient ratios for the requested nuclei. If no
appropriate EDratio is found on the probe file the parameter is set to the ratio of
the frequencies of the chosen pair of nuclei being detected.
