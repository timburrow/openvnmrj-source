hmqctoxy3d - HMQC-TOCSY 3D sequence with presaturation option
              - written in hypercomplex phase sensitive mode only

   sequence:

   HMQC-TOCSY:

   status   : A|--------------B-----------------|C-|---D----|-E-
     1H     :   90-1/2J-        180        -1/2J-t2-spinlock-Acq (t3)
      X     :           90-t1/2-   -t1/2-90     -BB-         -BB
  phtable   :   t1      t2      t6       t6           t3      t4 or t5    

   Parameters:

         d2 = First evolution time
         d3 = second evolution time
        mix = TOCSY mixing time
     pwxlvl = power level for X pulses
     pwx    = 90 degree X pulse
     j1xh   = X-H coupling constant
     dpwr   = power level for X decoupling
     tpwr   = power level for H pulses
     pw     = 90 degree H hard pulse
     slpwr  = power level for spinlock
     slpw   = 90 degree H pulse for mlev17
     trim   = trim pulse preceeding mlev17
     phase  = 1,2: gives HYPERCOMPLEX (t1) acquisition;
     ni     = number of t1 increments
     phase2 = 1,2: gives HYPERCOMPLEX (t2) acquisition;
     ni2    = number of t2 increments
     satflg = 'y':  presaturation during satdly
     satfrq = presaturation frequency
     satdly = saturation time during the relaxation period
     satpwr = saturation power for all periods of presaturation with xmtr
    wdwfctr = multiplication "window" factor of slpw
    nullflg = TANGO nullflg flag for protons not attached to X
    hmqcflg = 'n': turns off HMQC part of the sequence

   F1 x F3 : wft2d(1,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0)  i.e., wft2da
   F2 x F3 : wft2d(1,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0) if hmqcflg = 'n'  i.e., wft2da
             wft2d(1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0) if hmqcflg = 'y'

   3D processing:
	3d coef created using make3dcoef macro:
		f1coef = '1 0 0 0 0 0 -1 0'
		f2coef = '1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0'
