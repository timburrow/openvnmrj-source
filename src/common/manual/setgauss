setgauss  Set Gaussian fraction for deconvolution.

Format:	  setgauss(fraction)

	  After an initial deconvolution using pure Lorentzian line shapes,
	  the setgauss command will copy the results of the previous
	  deconvolution to become the starting parameters for a subsequent
	  deconvolution, but modifying them by adding in a starting guess
	  for a Gaussian fraction.

Examples: setgauss(0.3)
