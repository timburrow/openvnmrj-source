singlesession         - only allow a single VnmrJ session per owner account
singlesession('off')  - only multiple VnmrJ sessions per owner account

The singlesession macro controls whether multiple VnmrJ sessions can run at the
same time in a single login account.  This works on a per-user basis. For example,
it the system has accounts for vnmr1, walkup, solids, and imaging, each account
has control over whether or not multiple sessions of VnmrJ are allowed.

Executing singlesession with no arguments enforces a single session of Vnmrj
within that login account.
Executing singlesession('off') allows multiple VnmrJ sessions within that login account.

If, for some reason, you believe that a VnmrJ session is being incorrectly disallowed,
from a Linux terminal window, enter the command
  rm ~/vnmrsys/persistence/singleSession
