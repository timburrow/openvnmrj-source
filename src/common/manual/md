mf(<from,> to) -  Move Fid to specified experiment
mp(<from,> to) -  Move Parameters to specified experiment
md(<from,> to) -  Move Parameters to specified experiment
mt(<from,> to) -  Move Text to specified experiment
mz(<from,> to) -  Move Integral Reset Points to specified experiment
******************************************************************************
  
  mf moves an FID and associated parameters from one experiment to another.
  The optional first argument specifies the experiment from
  which the FID is to be taken.  It defaults to the currently joined
  experment.  The last argument specifies which experiment the FID is to
  be moved to.  The text, the processed acquisition parameters and the
  current display and processing parameters are also moved to the
  specified experiment.

  mp takes the same arguments as mf.  It only moves the text and the
  current display, processing, and acquisition parameters from one
  experiment to another.  No FID is transferred.

  md takes the same arguments as mf.  It only moves the saved display
  parameters from one experiment to another.  The display parameters
  which are moved are those which have been created with the Sn (n=1,9)
  commands.

  mt takes the same arguments as mf.  It only moves the text from one
  experiment to another.  No FID or parameters are transferred.

  mz takes the same arguments as mf. It only moves the integral reset
  points (lifrq and liamp parameters) from one experiment to another.
