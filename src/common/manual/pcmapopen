**************************************************************************

Syntax:		pcmapopen([<filename>,]<max_index>)
		pcmapclose


Description:	"pcmapopen" explicitly opens a phase correction map file
		using memory mapped I/O.

		It assumes the phase correction map file to be opened 
		resides in the user's $vnmruser/expN/datdir directory where 
		N is the current experiment number.  If the "filename"
		argument is not given, the command defaults to the filename
		"pcmap".  The "max_index" argument must always be supplied
		and be greater than or equal to the maximum number of
		phase maps stored in the file.  Once the phase correction
		map is opened the phase correction commands "pcmapgen"
		and "pcmapapply" can be used to generate maps and correct 
		data.

		Explicitly opening a phase correction map file can 
		significantly speed up the data processing.  The "pcmap"
		commands have been developed for processing Echo Planar
		images, but can also be used for other applications if
		applicable. 

		Once the file has been opened a "pcmapclose" command must
		be used to close the file when finished. 

		"pcmapclose"  closes phase correction map file that has been  
		explicitly opened with a "pcmapopen" command.


Arguments:	'filename' optional argument specifying the phase correction
		map file name residing in the user's $vnmruser/expN/datdir
		directory.

		'max_index' argument specifying the maximum number of phase
		correction maps in the file.  This is to ensure the memory
		mapping extends to or past the end of the file.


 Example:	pcmapopen('pcmap',2)
		pcmapclose
