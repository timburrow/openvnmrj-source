 vsadjh - Automatic vertical scale adjustment for H1 spectra (M)

      Syntax: vsadjh<(height<,dontIgnoreSolvent>)>

 Description: "vsadjh" works as "vsadj", but excludes certain signals from
		proton spectra: solvent and TMS signals are disregarded, and
		if from the remaining spectrum the highest line is more than
		three times as high as the second highest line, the spectrum
		is scaled to this second highest signal (otherwise the highest
		signal is taken as relevant). Any second argument lets it
		regard the solvent line as normal signal (i.e., only exclude
		the TMS line). If the first argument is 0 or a negative value
		it defaults to 0.9*(wc2max-vp-sc2), which also is the default
		without argument.

   Arguments: height - the desired height of the largest (or largest relevant)
		signal in the displayed portion of the spectrum.
	      ignoresolvent - any second argument will cause "vsadjh" to not
		ignore the solvent line. This was made for situation where
		frequently there are high "real" signals at the position of
		the solvent line. Such signals could otherwise be regarded as
		solvent line and would then be ignored - this could then lead
		to overscaling in the result.

    Examples: vsadjh
	      vsadjh(0.7*wc2max)
