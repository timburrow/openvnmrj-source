mspec - a command to select multiple spectra to display.
******************************************************************************

mspec can be used to select multiple spectra. Once the spectra are selected, the ds command is in mspec mode, i.e., it will display the selected spectra.

Note, mspec command itself does not display the spectra. 

To exit mspec mode (i.e., return to standard ds mode), use ds(n), or mspec('clear').

To turn off/on mspec mode withtout clearing the selection, use mspec('off') and mspec('on').

In mspec mode, all spectra should have the same spans (spectral width), but each spectrum may have different resolutions (fn).


-------------- 1. SELECT SPECTRA BY INDEXES OF ARRAYED DATA ----------------

The following commands select traces from arrayed spectra in current experiment.

mspec(index1,index2, index3,...<,color1,color2,...>) or
mspec(index1,color1,index2,color2,...)
  e.g., mspec(1,3,5,'blue') to display traces 1,3,5 in blue.
	mspec(1,'blue',2,'cyan',3,'yellow')
 
mspec('all'<,color1, color2,...>) 
	select all traces in arrayed data, up to 64.

mspec('first-last:step'<,color1, color2,...>)
  e.g., mspec('1-') to select all traces
	mspec('65-') to select 65 to last trace 
	mspec('1-:2') to select every other traces
	mspec('10-20:2') to select traces 10,12,14,16,18,20

If color is not specified, the default spectrum color (i.e., 'spectrum') will be used.
If fewer color(s) than spectra are specified, the color(s) will be recycled.

Colors are specified by names: 
	'red','green','blue','cyan','magenta','yellow','orange','black','white',
	'pink','gray' 'spectrum','spectrum2' to 'spectrum9','cursor','integral',
	'threshold','scale','fid','imaginary','parameter'.


----------------- 2. SELECT SPECTRA BY KEYS -------------------

A spectrum key is a name given when a fdf spectra data is loaded 
(see CPR for savefdfspec and aipLoadSpec commands). 

The following are special keys reserved for data in current experiment:
  'FID' - data in current fid buffer,
  'SPEC' - data in current phasefile buffer,
  'BASE' - data in current baseline buffer.

comboKey is a string to combine (add/subtract/scale) spectra, or select a trace.

For examples:
key1='SPEC' -current trace in SPEC
key2='spec' -current trace in spec
key3='SPEC-spec' -difference between current traces in SPEC and spec
key3='spec:2' - second trace in spec
key4='spec*0.5' - scale current trace in spec by half.

The following commands select spectra by keys or comboKeys (see below).

mspec(key1,key2,key3,...) 
	key1,key2,... are spectrum keys or comboKeys. 
	Note, all arguments should be string, and are interpreted as keys or comboKeys.

mspec(n,comboKey,yoff,color) 
	This selects one spectrum at a time. 
        Note, the comboKey has to contain ':', so it will not be confused with colorNames. 
        Spectrum n is specified by a given key, and 
	will be displayed with vertical offset yoff, in a given color.
        yoff is specified in milllimiters, color is specified by name.

e.g., mspec(1,'spec:1', 0, 'cyan')
      mspec(2,'baseline:1', 0, 'yellow')
      mspec(3,'spec:1-baseline:1', 40, 'red')

This will display the first trace of a spectral data, and the first trace of a baseline data at the same vertical offset, and display the difference 40mm above.
