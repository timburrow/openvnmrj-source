			fiddle example files
			====================

This is a small collection of fids recorded on an old 
XL300 and converted to Vnmr format, and illustrates 
some of the simple ways that fiddle can be used 
to extract worthwhile results from poor quality 
data.  The three files are

mixture			a mixture of acetone and ethanol in 
			CDCl3, with very poor shimming 
			and severe spinning sidebands

ODCB			a (folded) spectrum of a sample 
			containing ODCB and TMS, again 
			recorded with very poor shimming 
			and severe spinning sidebands

NOED			an arrayed pair of fids for an 
			NOE difference experiment with 
			gated irradiation [see Magn.Reson. 
			Chem. 27, 1085-1089 (1989)], this 
			time with OK shimming (but nasty 
			decoupler spikes)


To try out fiddle with these files, simply load them 
into an experiment, type text and follow the 
instructions displayed.
