"rotate(<x>)" leads to an effective rotation of the 2D spectrum by x
degrees.  If x is not specified as an argument to the rotate command,
a default value of 45 degrees is used.  A value of 45 for x leads to
a 45-degree counter-clockwise rotation.  The command rotate works for
both complex and hypercomplex 2D data.

"foldj" symmetrizes heteronuclear 2D-J or rotated homonuclear 2D-J exper-
iments about the F1=0 axis and functions with both complex and hypercomplex
2D data.

"foldt(<sym_op>)" folds COSY-like correlation spectra about the diagonal.
The 2D spectrum must exhibit a P-type diagonal in order for foldt to work
properly.  [A P-type diagonal is one which goes from the bottom left-hand
side to the top right-hand side of the contour display.]  The argument
sym_op can take three string values:  'symm', 'triang' and 'covar'.
The default value is 'symm'.
   If sym_op = 'symm', the folding process performs a symmetrization of the
   data by replacing every two symmetry-related points with the one point
   therein which is the smallest in magnitude.
   If sym_op = 'triang', the folding process performs a triangularization
   of the data by replacing every two symmetry-related points with their
   geometric mean.
   If sym_op = 'covar', for "covariance NMR", the folding process answers
   the question of whether the two symmetry-related points are correlated.
   If the product of the two points (a and b) is greater than 0.0, the two
   points are each replaced with the sqrt(a*b). Otherwise, the two points
   are set to 0.0.
The command foldt functions for both hypercomplex and complex 2D data but
requires that fn=fn1.

"foldcc" symmetrizes 2D INADEQUATE data along the P-type double-quantum
axis and applies an automatic DC baseline correction.  The command foldcc
functions for both hypercomplex and comlex 2D data.
