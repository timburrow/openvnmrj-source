************************************************************

This macro kills and removes all current print jobs in the print
queue for the active printer in Vnmr.  Unless the user execut-
ing this macro is root (superuser), only that user's print jobs
will be deleted from the print queue.

It is remotely possible that the printer may have to be re-
initialized after the execution of this macro.  Re-initialization
is accomplished by turning the printer off and then turning it
back on after a few seconds.

If one port has been configured to be both a printer and a plotter,
killprint can cause both print AND plot jobs to that port to be
deleted.  As an example, if printer = 'LaserJet_300' and plotter =
'LaserJet_300R' and if one has typed "pl pscale page" followed by
"ptext(vnmruser+'/psglib/noesy.c')", killprint will delete both
jobs despite the fact that the former is a plot job and the latter,
a print job.
