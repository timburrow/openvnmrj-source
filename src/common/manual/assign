*******************************************************************************
cla - clear all line assignments
assign - assigns nearest calculated transition to most experimental lines 
assign<t#,l#> - assign a transition to an experimental line 
*******************************************************************************
cla - 	clears the line assignment parameters for spin simulation
 	iteration which matches simulated spectra to actual data.
        The parameters are 'clindex', and 'slfreq'.

assign - no argument - assigns the nearest calculated transition to the
	lines from a 'dll/nll' listing after 'spinll' has placed them in
	'slfreq'. All lines may not be assigned and transitions must be 
	greater than 'sth'. The next 'spins('iterate')' determines new param-
	eters to minimize the differences in position of the assigned pairs.
assign('mark') uses the lines selected with the 'mark' button in place of 'dll'

assign(t#,l#) -  assigns a single calculated transition number (t#).
	to a line from the 'dll' listing (index is l#) 

assign(t#,0) - removes an assignment from a calculated transition.
