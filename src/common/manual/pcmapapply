pcmapapply	Apply Phase Correction Map to Data (C) 
**************************************************************************

Syntax:		pcmapapply([<filename>,]<index>)


Description:	"pcmapapply" applies a pixel by pixel phase shift to the
		current datafile using the complex phase correction values
		from the phase correction map $vnmruser/expN/datdir/<filename>.

		It assumes the phase correction map file to be opened 
		resides in the user's $vnmruser/expN/datdir directory where 
		N is the current experiment number.  If the "filename"
		argument is not given, the command defaults to the filename
		"pcmap".  The "index" argument must always be supplied,
		ranges from 1 to n, and specifies the desired correction map
		block within the file.

		The phase correction values are generated by "pcmapgen".
		One or more phase correction maps may be generated. 
		In the case of a multislice EPI experiment there may be
		one phase correction map for each slice.   As mentioned
		before, the command uses data from the current datafile;
		which means that a fourier transform must have been
		performed on the data.  For images, a "ft1d" should be
		done on the data before using this command.

		"pcmapapply" will open and close the phase map file unless 
		it has been explicitly opened with "pcmapopen".  Explicitly
		opening a phase correction map file may be desired if there
		are a large number of images or data sets to be processed.

		The "pcmap" commands have been developed for processing 
		Echo Planar images, but can also be used for other 
		applications if applicable. 


Arguments:	'filename' optional argument specifying the phase correction
		map file name residing in the user's $vnmruser/expN/datdir
		directory.  The default file is $vnmruser/expN/datdir/pcmap.

		'index' argument specifying which phase correction map to use
		in the file.  This value will usually be 1.


 Example:	ft1d('nf',2)
		pcmapapply(1)
		ft2d('nf',2)
