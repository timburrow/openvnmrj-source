adept<('noll','coef','theory')>  - automatic DEPT analysis and spectrum editing
padept<('noll','coef','theory')> - plot automatic DEPT analysis
*******************************************************************************

  A set of 4 DEPT spectra can be automatically analyzed and spectrum
  editing can be performed, so that the 4 arrayed spectra are as
  follows:

	#4:	CH3 carbons only
	#3:	CH2 carbons only
	#2:	CH  carbons only
	#1:	all protonated carbons


  "adept" will first perform a line listing. Therefore, "th" has to
  be set properly. "adept('noll')" does not perform a line listing.
  The argument 'coef' will cause the combination coeficients to be
  printed.  The argument 'theory' will cause the theoretical coeficients
  rather than optimized coeficients to be used.  The optional arguments
  'noll',  'coef',  and 'theory' may be supplied in any order.

  Note, that "adept" modifies the transformed data. Therefore, it
  should not be called twice without retransforming the data in
  between the two calls. "adept" produces a text file 'dept.out'
  in the current experiment directory, which contains the result of 
  the analysis.

  "padept" will perform the "adept" analysis and plot the resulting
  spectra, a scale, and the assigned line listing. Enough space 
  should be left at the left end of the display for the line list.
