explib	  Display experiment library

Format:	  explib

	  Displays a library of the currently available experiment files
	  (exp1 through exp9).  For each experiment, explib dislays the
          name of the experiment, and its subexperiments, whether an
          acquisition is active or its position in the acquisition queue,
          the current size of the experiment, the pulse sequence currently
          active in the experiment, and the first 50 characters of the
          text file in the experiment are displayed.
          Explib also displays a message if the system is in automation mode.
