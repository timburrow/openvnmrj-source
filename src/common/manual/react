react            - Macro to recover from error conditions during werr processing
react('wait')    - Macro to recover from error conditions during werr processing
*******************************************************************************

  When an acquisition error occurs,  any action specified by the werr parameter
  is executed.  The react macro is a prototype for handling these errors. This
  macro can be invoked for error handling by setting werr='react'.  The acqstatus
  parameter is provided so that react can determine which specific error has occurred.
  See the manual acq_errors for the values that acqstatus can assume.
  During an automation run,  a special case of error handling can arise.  The react
  macro always uses the 'next' option when it calls au.  Under certain conditions,
  it is also appropriate to use the 'wait' option.  The react macro checks to see
  if an argument was passed to it ,that is, werr='werr(\'wait\')' to determine
  whether to use the 'wait' option of au.
