analyze('expfit','xarray'<,'option','option,...>)	- curve fitting
analyze('expfit','regression'<,'option','option',...>)  - regression mode
*******************************************************************************

   Description: Provides an interface to the curve fitting program, 'expfit',
		supplying it with input data in the form of a text file
		'analyze.inp' in the current experiment.  'xarray' is the
		name of the parameter array holding x-values in T1, T2,
		kinetics, and contact_time, and used only with these options.

		The UNIX program 'expfit' is called with the following syntax:
			expfit option(s) <analyze.inp  >analyze.list

		The program expfit does a least-squares curve fitting to
		the data supplied in 'analyze.inp'. Macros are available
		for the specialized uses of analyze such as 't1' and 'kinetics'.
		These macros avoid the need for the user to select options
                and get the correct file format.
		In the regression mode, (if 'regression' is an argument)
		the type of curve fitting, 
		('poly1',...) must be selected.  For regression 
		(generalized curve fitting), the regression section in 
		the Operation Manual gives the input file format and 
		describes the menus that permit options choices 
		indirectly through menu buttons.  

	Files:	The text file analyze.inp which for T1, T2, kinetics,
			contact_time, and regression, contains:
	  	<optional descriptive text line>				
	  	<optional y-axis title - regression only>			
	  	number of peaks(data sets)   number of (x,y) pairs per peak		
			and, regression only, x scale type   y scale type
  		<NEXT  	number of (x,y) pairs for this peak > 
		index#(1)
	  	x y   (first peak,first pair)					
	  	x y   (first peak,second pair)				
	  	......	
  		<NEXT  	number of (x,y) pairs for this peak > 
		index#(2)
	  	x y   (second peak, first pair)	
	  	......
	
		In the regression mode the line beginning with
		'NEXT' is inserted at the start of the data for each 
		peak when the number of pairs per peak is variable.
  		In this case, the header contains the maximum number 
  		of pairs for any peak.

	        For T1, T2, kinetics, and contact_time, information from 
		the file 'fp.out' and values of the arrayed parameter
 		'xarray' are used to construct this file. It is necessary 
		to run 'fp' prior to 'analyze'.  For regression, this file
	        'analyze.inp' is made by running "expl('regression')".
   	        If the regression mode is not selected, 'analyze.inp'
		may be slightly different.	

		'expfit' also makes a file 'analyze.out', which is used
		by 'expl' to display the results of the analysis, in 
		addition to output to the standard output, which is
		usually directed to 'analyze.list'.

       Options:	The following options are implemented in 'analyze':

		    T1		Perform T1 analysis (default)
		    T2		Perform T2 analysis
		    kinetics    Perform kinetics analysis
					decreasing peak height
                                The last four arguments are used to add
                                a time offset between the array elements. 
                                In the example below, the time increment is
                                (d1 + d2 + at) * nt
		    increment   Perform kinetics analysis with
					increasing peak height
                                The last four arguments are the same as
                                in the kinetics case.
		    list	Extended listing for each peak
		    diffusion   A special analysis for diffusion experiments
		    contact_time A special analysis for solids cross-
					polarization spin-lock experiments
		    regression  Sets regression mode, signifies generalized
					curve fitting with choices
					poly1, poly2, poly3, and exp
		    poly1	With regression, a linear fitting
		    poly2	With regression, a quadratic fitting
		    poly3	With regression, a cubic curve fitting
		    exp		With regression, an exponential curve fitting
