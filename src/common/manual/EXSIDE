EXSIDE - Experiment to measure long-range 1H-13C couplings as pure-phase responses in F1

The (HC)EXSIDE experiment is very special and provides a method to measure long-range
H/C coupling constants. To setup first acquire a gCOSY and take note of which protons
are coupled to one another. Next acquire a selexcit experiment where the multi-band
option is selected and chose all desired protons being careful to not include any pairs
from the same spin system. Setup EXSIDE from there. The coupling constants will be in
phase pairs in the F1 dimension scaled by a jscaling parameter. If the jscale factor
were 10 the true coupling constant would be the F1 separation/10.

The selective excitation selections can also made made from the EXSIDE experiment's
panels. Everything required to setup the experiment can be found on the Acquire -> Default
panel.
