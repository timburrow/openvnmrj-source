****************************************************************************

The `makefid' command lets you introduce computed data into your experiment.
The input files contains numeric values, 2 per line.  The first value is
assigned to the X (or real) channel; the second value on the line is
assigned to the Y (or imaginary) channel.

The first argument, which is required, is the name of the file containing
input.  Arguments specifying the element number and the format are optional
and may be entered in either order.

The element number is any integer greater than or equal to 0.  If 0 is passed,
the existing FID file is deleted and element 1 will be added. If the element
number is greater than 0, then that element will be added.  If that element
already exists in your FID file, the program will overwrite the old data.
If not entered, the default is 1.

The format argument lets you select between single precision integer, double
precision integer, or floating point data in the resulting FID file.
Use one of the following character strings to specify the format:

	'dp=n'			single precision (16-bit) data
	'dp=y'			double precision (32-bit) data
	'16-bit'		single precision (16-bit) data
	'32-bit'		double precision (32-bit) data
	'float'		        floating point   (32-bit) data

The number of points comes from the number of numeric values read from the
file.  `makefid' reads only 2 values per line.

If the current experiment already contains a FID, you will not be able to
change either the format or the number of points from that present in the
FID file.  Use this command to remove the FID:

	rm(curexp+'/acqfil/fid')

Be aware that `makefid' does not look at parameter values when establishing
the format of the data or the number of points in an element.  Thus if the
FID file is not present it is possible for `makefid' to write a FID file
with a header that does not match the value of `dp' or `np'.  Since the
active value is in the processed tree, you will need to use the `setvalue'
command if any changes are needed.

Be aware that `makefid' can modify saved data; that is, data returned to an
experiment with the `rt' command.  Either supply 0 as the element number or
execute this sequence of VNMR commands to avoid this:

	cp(curexp+'/acqfil/fid',curexp+'/acqfil/fidtmp')
	rm(curexp+'/acqfil/fid')
	mv(curexp+'/acqfil/fidtmp',curexp+'/acqfil/fid')



An alternative form of makefid will calculate an FID based on the frequency,
amplitude, decay rate, and phase of a spectral line. The first argument,
which is required, is the name of the file containing input.  Arguments
specifying the element number and the keyword 'calc' and may be entered
in either order. The 'calc' keyword is not optional. The element number
is optional. As above, using an element number of 0 will delete the current
FID file before adding element 1.  Examples include:

makefid(curexp+'/fidlines','calc')
makefid(curexp+'/fidlines','calc',1)
makefid(curexp+'/fidlines',1,'calc')

The input file specifies the frequency, amplitude, decay rate and phase.
All four numbers must be on a single line. Multiple lines may be in the
file. Lines starting with a # are comments. Blank lines are ignored.
An example file is:

# Freq   Amp   Decay Phase
  2500.0 10.0  0.1   0.0
  0.0    20.0  0.1   0.0

The current values of the sw and np parameters are used to determine 
the dwell time and the number of points to calculate.  The frequencies
range between -sw/2 and sw/2. A 0.0 frequency will give a peak in the
middle of the spectrum.

If only a single line is to be calculated, makefid can be called with
the keyword 'calcstr' and the  frequency, amplitude, decay rate and phase
of that line can be passed as the second argument. The second argument must
be a string of space separated list of the parameters. The optional element
number can also be passed as the final argument. Examples include:

makefid('calcstr','2500.0 10.0 0.1 0.0',0)
makefid('calcstr','2500.0 10.0 0.1 0.0',2)
makefid('calcstr','2500.0 10.0 0.1 0.0')


writefid
--------
The `writefid' command writes a text file using data from the selected FID
element.  The default element number is 1.  The program writes 2 values
per line.  The first is the value from the X (or real) channel; the second
is the value from the Y (or imaginary) channel.
