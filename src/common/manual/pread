pread('filename'<,index>)   read 1D pipe data.
pread('filename')           read 2D pipe data.

pread('filename') will remove any current datdir/data and datdir/phasefile
files and replace them with the pipe data from the 'filename' file.
Either 1D or 2D data can be read. The parameters must agree with the
data to be read.  For example, the values of fn and fn1 must be consistent
with the pipe data. Note that this is not a generic reader for pipe data.
It is assumed that the pipe data are originally generated based on the
values of the VNMR parameters.

Both real and complex 1D data can be read. At present, only 2D data that
is real in both dimensions can be read. It cannot read 2D data that is
complex.

For 1D pipe data, an optional index argument can be used.
pread('filename',1) will check if the number of points and complex/real
state of the pipe data matches the data currently in datdir. If it does,
it replaces element 1 with pipe data. If the number of points or the
complex/real states do not match, it behaves like pread without an index.

pread('filename',index) where index is greater than 1 checks the number
of points and complex/real states. If they do not match, it gives an error.
If the index is more than 1 larger than the current number of elements
in datdir/data, it gives an error. Otherwise, it will replace the "index"
element or add a new element to the end of the array.

The filename argument can be either an absolute path name or a path relative
to the current experiment directory (curexp). The following are equivalent:
    pread('test.ft')
    pread(curexp+'/test.ft')
