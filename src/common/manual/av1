The commands ph1, av1, pwr1, and pa1 operate by setting the parameter 
dmg1 to a particular value.  ph1 sets dmg1 = 'ph1'; av1, dmg1 = 'av1'; 
pwr1, dmg1 = 'pwr1'; and pa1, dmg1 = 'pa1'.  If the parameter dmg1 does 
not exist, each of these commands will create it and set it to the 
appropriate string value.

In the phased mode, which is selected by ph1, each real point in the
displayed F1 trace is calculated from a linear combination of the REAL
and IMAGINARY points comprising each respective F1 complex data point.
For hypercomplex data, the linear combination uses the REAL-REAL and
IMAGINARY-REAL points from each respective F1 hypercomplex data point.
The coefficients for this linear combination are derived from the phase
parameters "rp1" and "lp1".

In the absolute value mode, which is selected by av1, each real point
in the displayed F1 trace is calculated as the square root of the sum
of the squares of the REAL and IMAGINARY points comprising each respec-
tive F1 complex data point.  For hypercomplex data, the REAL-REAL and
IMAGINARY-REAL points from each respective F1 hypercomplex data point
are used in the summation.  In this mode, all information, including
noise, is always positive; and the relationship between signal and noise
is linear.

In the power mode, which is selected by pwr1, each real point in the
displayed F1 trace is calculated as the sum of the squares of the REAL
and IMAGINARY points comprising each respective F1 complex data point.
For hypercomplex data, the REAL-REAL and IMAGINARY-REAL points from
each respective F1 hypercomplex data point are used in the summation.
In this mode, all information, including noise, is always positive; and
the relationship between signal and noise is non-linear.

In the phase angle mode, which is selected by pa1, each real point in the
displayed F1 trace is calculated from a linear combination of the REAL
and IMAGINARY points comprising each respective F1 complex data point.
For hypercomplex data, this mode is not available.  The phase angle also
includes the phase parameters "rp1" and "lp1".

For the contour display of 2D data, the result of the commands ph1, av1,
pwr1, and pa1 are the same as for F1 traces provided that pmode = 'partial' 
or pmode = ''.
