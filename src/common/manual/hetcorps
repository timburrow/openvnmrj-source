hetcorps - heteronuclear chemical shift correlation
              (absolute value and phase sensitive)

 Parameters:

      pw  -  90 degree pulse on the observe nucleus
    tpwr  -  transmitter power level; only for systems with a linear
             amplifier on the transmitter channel
      pp  -  proton 90 degree pulse on the decoupler channel
   pplvl  -  decoupler power level; only for systems with a linear
             amplifier on the decoupler channel; otherwise decoupler
             is turned to to full-power for pulses on systems that
             have bilevel decoupling capability
     dhp  -  decoupler power level during acquisition
    dpwr  -  decoupler power level during acquisition for systems with
	     linear amplifiers
   hmult  -  'n': remove non-geminal proton-proton couplings in F1
             'y': preserve all proton-proton couplings in F1
   chonly -  'y': gives CH only spectrum
   oddeven-  'y': gives CH and CH3 positive and CH2 negative
             'n': gives all positive
             This parameter is irrelevant in av (phase=0) spectrum
              or if chonly = 'y' 
    j1xh  -  one-bond heternuclear coupling constant
   phase  -  1,2 - Hypercomplex
             0   - absolute value
      nt  -  1 (minimum for hypercomplex)
             2 (minimum for absolute value)
             multiple of 2 (recommended for hypercomplex)
                         4 (recommended for absolute value)

   NOTE : Cannot and should not be used for long-range correlation
          For long-range correlation use lrhetcor.c

          If C13 parameters (after phase correcting a 13C spectrum) is moved
          to set up hetcorps, there should be no need to phase correct either
          F1 or F2!!!!

          use gaussian windows
