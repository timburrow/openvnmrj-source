*************************************************************
wettntocsy - macro for creating wettntocsy parameters from a WET parameter set
        (see the dglc parameter screen)
*************************************************************

  wet - a y/n flag determining whether the WET element is used
        (which uses pwwet, wetpwr, wetshape, gtw, gzlvlw, and gswet).
  wetpwr - the power level for the WET element.
  pwwet - the pw90 pulse width at wetpwr.
  wetshape - the pulse shape used during the wet element.
  gtw - the duration of the spoiling gradient (in sec).
  gzlvlw - the amplitude of the gtw gradient. 
  gswet - the recovery time following each gradient (try 0.002).

  c13wet - a y/n flag controlling the selective 13C decoupling used during WET
        (which uses dorwet, dpwrwet, and dmfwet; hardcoded to be WALTZ).
  dofwet - the 13C decoupler offset used during WET.
  dpwrwet - the decoupler power level for c13wet.
  dmfwet - the dmf value used for c13wet.

  dz - the delay following the wet element to allow longitudinal recovery
        (like a T1IR or WEFT inversion recovering through zero).
  composit - a y/n flag determining whether a composite read pulse is used.


 tntocsy - total correlation spectroscopy  (a.k.a. hohaha)
	   using transmitter presaturation
	   "clean tocsy" used with windowing and MLEV16+60degree spin lock

    ref: a. bax and d.g. davis, j. magn. reson. 65, 355 (1985)
         m. levitt, r. freeman, and t. frenkiel, j. magn. reson. 47, 328 (1982)

  Parameters:

        pw = 90 degree pulse during mlev periods (at power level tpwr)
        p1 = 90 degree excitation pulse (at power p1lvl)
    window = clean-tocsy window(in us)
    satdly = length of presaturation;
   satmode = flag for presat control (NOT NEEDED WITH WET)
               'yn' for during relaxation delay only
               'yy' for during both "relaxation delay" and "d2" (recommended)
     phase = 1,2: for HYPERCOMPLEX phase-sensitive F1 quadrature
               3: for TPPI phase-sensitive F1 quadrature
     sspul = 'y':  trim(x)-trim(y) sequence at beginning of D1 delay
             'n':  normal D1 delay
      trim = spinlock trim pulse time (0.002 recommended)
       mix = mixing time  (can be arrayed)
        nt = min:  multiple of 2
             max:  multiple of 8  (recommended)

	THE TRANSMITTER MUST BE POSITIONED AT SOLVENT FREQUENCY 
             this pulse sequence requires a T/R switch, and
             linear amplifiers and computer-controlled attenuators on the
             observe channel.
NOTE: the wettntocsy pulse sequence is not supplied with Mercury or GEMINI 2000.
