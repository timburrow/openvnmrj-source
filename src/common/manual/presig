****************************************************************************
presig		Preamp Signal Level Selection Parameter   (parameter)  
****************************************************************************

Applicability:	SIS Imaging Systems or UnityPlus Spectrometers with 
		Selectable Large-Signal Mode Preamps.

Description:    This parameter is to be used with systems that support
		large signal handling at the preamp.  It allows the user
		to select high signal handling "presig='h'" or low signal
		handling "presig='l'".  Currently there are two types of
		preamps that support this capability. 

		UnityPlus Spectrometers with Selectable Large-Signal Mode 
		Preamps support this capability by allowing a current
		increase the preamp.  This allows larger signals, and the
		overall signal level will be slightly higher.

		UnityPlus SIS Imaging Spectrometers support this capability 
		using attenuation and a current increase. This  allows 
		larger signals and results in a lower overall signal level.

		The use of this parameter to control the hardware depends 
		on the Magnet Leg Driver Board Configuration ID being set 
		to 16 for SIS Imaging Systems or 1 for UnityPlus Spectrometers 
		with Selectable Large-Signal Mode Preamp.


Values:		'h' signifies high signal mode at the preamp.
		'l' signifies low signal mode at the preamp.
		'n' signifies "not used" and will default to low
		    signal mode at the preamp if the hardware is present.
