*******************************************************************************

      Syntax: vsadj2<(height)>:scalingfactor

 Description: "vsadj2" adjusts the vertical scale by powers of two only, as
		required for expansion plots (see "aexppl"). The scaling factor
		is returned to the calling macro.

   Arguments: height - the desired height of the largest (or largest relevant)
		signal in the displayed portion of the spectrum; default is
		0.9*(wc2max-vp-sc2).
	      scalingfactor - the ratio of the new versus the old value of "vs"
		is returned to the calling macro by vsadj2.

    Examples: vsadj2
	      vsadj2(50):r1

   Alternate: "Adj VS" button in the 1D Data Manipulation menu
