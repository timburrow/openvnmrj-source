*******************************************************************************
aa	- 	abort acquisition and do werr processing
halt	-	halt acquisition and do wexp processing
halt2	-	halt acquisition with do no processing
*******************************************************************************

  These commands are used to abort an experiment that has been submitted to
  acquisition.  If the experiment is active, it is aborted immediately.
  Note that all data is discarded.  Any data collected from an earlier block
  size transfer is retained.  The login name, and the fid directory path
  in 'file' are used as keys to find the proper experiment to abort.

  Under some circumstances, there is a delay between the time go is typed
  and the acquisition is actually started.  During this time, instructions
  based on the selected pulse sequence are being generated. Under these
  circumstances, these commands will report that no acquisition is active
  but will instead stop the instruction generation process and the message
  PSG aborted will appear.

  If the acquisition was started with the au command, then wbs, wnt, wexp, and
  werr processing may be defined.
  The aa command that aborts an active acquisition is interpreted as an
  error and if any "werr" processing is defined,  this processing will occur.
  The halt command is identical to aa except it is not interpreted as an
  error but rather as a experiment complete.  If the halt is used and
  "wexp" processing is defined,  that processing will occur.
  The halt2 command that aborts an active acquisition is interpreted as if
  the acquisition was started with a go rather and an au. That is, neither
  werr nor wexp processing will occur.

  Following the aa, halt, or halt2 command,  any queued experiments will begin.
