peak<(highfield,lowfield)>:ht,frq,amp	 -	Find the maximum point
peakmin<(highfield,lowfield)>:ht,frq,amp -	Find the minimum point
maxpeak<(highfield,lowfield)>:ht,frq,amp -      Find the maximum point of all traces of arrayed 1D spectra.
*******************************************************************************

  peak finds the height and frequency of the maximum point in the
  specified region.  peakmin finds the height and frequency of the
  minimum point in the specified region.

  For both peak and peakmin, height is measured in mm, and frequency is
  measured in Hz, including any referencing (i.e. the same
  frequency that you would measure by placing a cursor on that point).
  Default parameters for highfield and lowfield are "sp" and "sp+wp",
  respectively.  The value of the height and frequency of the point
  can be returned to the caller if the command is suffixed with
  a colon and parameter names. An unscaled amplitude may be returned
  as the third value. This unscaled amplitude is independent of the
  current value of vs and whether the spectrum is in absolute intensity
  or normalized mode (ai or nm).
