hetcorHT:  Hadamard HETCOR experiment.

To set up a 2D Hadamard HETCOR experiment, hetcorHT:

  1) record a 1d C13 spectrum, ft and phase correct; 
  2) in another experiment record a H-1 spectrum;
  3) Select Setup Hadamard Encoding from Hadamard Experiments menu and
     set threshold as required. Click the "Create Line List" button and 
     edit the created line list if necessary (e.g. to remove the solvent
     peaks). Use Set List into Parameters button to save the line list.
     Transfer the list to the required experiment.
  4) return to experiment in step (1)
  5) Select the HETCOR experiment from the Hadamard Experiments -> 
     Use Current Parameters menu. Import the frequency list from 
     the experiment in step (2), if necessary.
  6) adjust any paramaters, if necessary, e.g. pw, ni, sw1, etc.;
  7) use the Sequence button to ensure the setup is correct and then Acquire 
     to start the experiment;
  8) process with wft2da (proc1 = 'ht') or use the Process menus.

  Experimental Parameters:
  ========================

      pw  -  90 degree pulse on the observe nucleus
    tpwr  -  transmitter power level; only for systems with a linear
             amplifier on the transmitter channel
      pp  -  proton 90 degree pulse on the decoupler channel
   pplvl  -  decoupler power level; only for systems with a linear
             amplifier on the decoupler channel; otherwise decoupler
             is turned to to full-power for pulses on systems that
             have bilevel decoupling capability
   compH  -  H-1 amplifier compression factor
    dpwr  -  decoupler power level during acquisition. 
  presat  -  'n': no presaturation of 13C signals
             'y': broadband presaturation of 13C signals
    j1xh  -  one-bond heternuclear coupling constant
    mult  -  multiplicity editing parameter

  Hadamard parameters:
  ====================

    htfrq1 - list of frequencies used for Hadamard encoding.
    ni     - number of increments. Must be a power of 2. Other allowed values 
             are n*12, n*20 and n*28, where n is a power of 2.
    htofs1 - ni offset. Sets the number of increments to be omitted. Typical
             value is htofs1 = 1.
    htbw1  - excitation bandwidth. For pshape = 'gaus180' good numbers are 
             90, 45, 30 or 20 Hz.
    pshape - shape used for Hadamard encoding, typically gaus180, square180,
             sinc180.
    bscor  - Bloch-Siegert shift correction for Hadamard encoding, typically 
             set bscor = 'y'.
    repflg - set repflg = 'n' to suppress Pbox reports. repflg = 'h' prints
             Hadamard matrix only.
    htss1  - stepsize for Hadamard encoding pulses. This parameter is adjusted
             by looking at the maximum phase increments in Hadamard enconing
             pulses, e.g. F1_2.RF. If unsure, set htss1 = 0 to disable it.
    pwpat  - CH decoupling (.RF) pulse. Use inversion pulses of 1 - 1.5 ms and
             an appropriate supercycle. The total length must be the same as  
             that of the Hadamard encoding pulse (F1_1.RF). For example, 
             with 45 ms long pulse us a 40 step supercycle (e.g. t5,m8) and
             1.125 ms long adiabatic pulse:
             >Pbox CHdec -w "wurst2i 25k/1.125m" -sucyc t5,m8 -s 5.0 -p ... -l ...       
             They are generated on-the-fly by pboxHT_dec().
    htcal1 - allows calibration of selective pulses. Set htcal1=ni, ni=0, nt=2, 
             and array htpwr1. If ni=12 (and others that are not a power of two) 
             use htcal1=8. Set compH such that pulse power matches the optimum 
             power found from the calibration.
    htss1  - stepsize for Hadamard encoding pulses. This parameter is adjusted
             by looking at the maximum phase increments in Hadamard enconing
             pulses, e.g. F1_2.RF. If unsure, set htss1 = 0 to disable it.
