SETNOETHER is a UNIX shellscript designed to disconnect the Host
Computer System from the Ethernet network.  Only Superuser (ROOT)
can execute this shellscript properly.  SETNOETHER will do nothing
if the system is already disconnected from the ethernet network.

SunOS:
    SETNOETHER copies the current `hosts' file to `hosts.ether'.
    SETNOETHER also renames the `hostname.le0' file so that
    ethernet is not activated on the Host Computer System at the
    next boot-up of UNIX.


Solaris:
    SETNOETHER renames `hostname.le0', `defaultdomain' and
    `defaultrouter' so that ethernet is not activated when the
    system is rebooted.  SETNOETHER will not affect the 2nd
    EtherNet interface on a GEMINI 2000
