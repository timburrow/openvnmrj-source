shimamp<:maxamp>    Return the maximum shim current of the current parameter set
                    as a percentage of the safety maximum
shimamp<:pos,neg>   Return the individual positive and negative shim currents of
                    the current parameter set as percentages of the safety maximum

The shim power supply has current limits for safe operation. Whenever new shims are
loaded into the shim power supply by setting load='y' and running su, go, ga, or au,
these limits are checked. The command will abort if the safety limits are exceeded.
The shimamp command will check the shim currents of the parameters and return
the total currents as a percentage of the maximum. There are individual limits
for positive and negative shim currents. With a sigle return value, the largest
of the shim currents will be returned. With two return values, the individual
positive and negative currents will be returned. Any return value between 0 and 100.0
is considered safe. Values greater than 100.0 with generate error messages.

To bypass this safety check, the 'nosafeshim' argument can be passed to the su / go
set of commands. These safety checks are also enforced during interact update of
the shims with the shimming panel.
