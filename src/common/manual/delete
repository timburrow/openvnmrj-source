delete		- 	remove files and .fid or .par directories
rm		-       implementation of the UNIX rm command
*******************************************************************************

  The rm command removes one or more files from the file system. 
  It works like the unix rm command.   All arguments and options
  are passed.  This command is very powerful and its use is not
  recommended.

  Usage  -  rm('filename')
	    rm('filename1','filename2')

  The delete command is a safer command than rm.  It will not allow
  "wildcard" characters nor the -r option.  It will, however, delete
  .fid and .par directories.  These are the only directories which
  normally will need to be removed.  (Experiment directories may be
  removed with the delexp command.)  The delete command will also
  delete files.  This command first searches for the filename passed
  as an argument.  If it finds that file and that file is not a directory,
  it will be deleted.  If the file is not found,  a .fid is appended
  to the file name.  If that directory is found, it will be removed.
  If the .fid file does not exist, a .par is appended and that file
  will be removed if it is found.

  Usage  -  delete('filename')
	    delete('filename1','filename2')
