 capt - Automated carbon and APT acquisition (M)
*******************************************************************************

      Syntax: capt<(solvent)>

 Description: prepares parameters for automatically acquiring a standard
              C13 spectrum, followed by a apt experiment. In non-automation
	      mode,  the carbon and apt spectra will be acquired in the
	      experiment in which the capt command was typed.  Following
	      the completion of the acquisition,  the commands rttmp('C13')
	      and rttmp('apt') may be used for further processing of the
	      carbon and apt spectra, respectively. 

   Arguments: solvent is the name of the solvent used. In automation mode,
	        this is supplied by the enter program. In non-automation
                mode, the default is 'cdcl3'.

    Examples: capt au
	      capt('dmso') nt=10000 au
