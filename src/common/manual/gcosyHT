gcosyHT:   Hadamard COSY experiment with gradient selection of coherences.

To set up a homonuclear Hadamard COSY experiment, gcosyHT:

  1) record a 1d H1 spectrum, ft and phase correct; 
  2) Select Setup Hadamard Encoding from Hadamard Experiments menu. Choose lb=20
     to 25 Hz and set threshold as required; 
     Use 25 Hz for the 2-ethyl-indanone sample and samples with large geminal
     couplings. 
  3) Click the "Create Line List" button and edit the created line list if 
     necessary.
  4) Select the COSY experiment from the Hadamard Experiments -> 
     Use Current Parameters menu.
  5) adjust any paramaters, if necessary, e.g. pw, ni, sw1, etc.;
  5) use the Sequence button to ensure the setup is correct and then Acquire 
     to start the experiment;
  6) process with wft2da (proc1 = 'ht') or use the Process menus.

Hadamard parameters:
====================

    parameters:
    ==========
    htfrq1 - list of frequencies for Hadamard encoding.
    htbw1 - excitation bandwidth. For pshape = 'gaus180' good numbers are 
          90, 45, 30 or 20 Hz.
    ni  - number of increments. Must be a power of 2. Other allowed values 
          are n*12, n*20 and n*28, where n is a power of 2.
    nimax  - sets limit to ni to prevent accidental unrealistic values.
    htofs1 - ni offset. Sets the number of increments to be omitted. Typical
            value is niofs = 1.
    pshape - shape used for Hadamard encoding, typically gaus180, square180,
             sinc180.
    httype - Hadamard encoding type. Allowed values are 'i' (inversion pulses
            are used for longitudinal encoding), 'e' and 'r' (excitation and
            refocusing pulses are used for transverse encoding). Nothe that
            pshape needs be chosen accordingly.
    bscor - Bloch-Siegert correction for Hadamard encoding, typically set 
            bscor = 'y'.
    repflg - set repflg = 'n' to suppress Pbox reports, repflg =  'h' prints
           Hadamard matrix only.
    compH - H-1 amplifier compression factor.           
    
    optional: 
    ========     
    htss1  - stepsize for Hadamard encoding pulses. If needed, this parameter 
             can be adjusted by looking at the maximum phase increments in 
             Hadamard enconing pulses, e.g. F1_2.RF. If unsure, set htss1 = 0 
             to disable it.
    htcal1 - allows calibration of selective pulses. Set mix=0, htcal1=ni, 
         ni=0 and array htpwr1. If ni=12 (and other that are not a power of 
         two) use htcal1=8. Adjust compH so that pulse power matches the 
         optimum power found from the calibration.
