The (HC)Crisis2 Tab Family

Information conveyed - H-C 2D chemical shift correlations for both direct and long-range
couplings.

These experiments differ from the many other options available by being adiabatic in both
the 13C and the 1H dimensions. Setup and use of all of these experiments is exactly the
same as the corresponding experiments found in the JnCH and J1CH tabs. There are also
in the (HC)Crisis2 tab two experiments that are multiplicity-edited.  The gc2h2bcme
and the gc2hmbcme experiments. Both of these experiments allow processing to yield
either CH/CH3 or C/CH2 2D subspectra.
