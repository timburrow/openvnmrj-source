      Syntax: isadj<(size<,neg_size>)>
	      isadj2<(size<,neg_size>)>:scalingfactor

 Description: "isadj" adjusts the size of the integrals such that the tallest
	      integral on display will be as big as specified in argument 1,
	      or such that it fits onto the paper if no argument was specified.
	      If negative integrals are present, they are given a limit of 10 mm
	      if io<10, or otherwise such that they end 5 mm above the spectrum.
	      Optionally, the maximum size of negative integrals can be entered
	      as a second argument. Whichever part of the integrals (positive
	      or negative) runs into the given limit will be used to scale "is".
	      "isadj2" has exactly the same functionality, except that it will
	      adjust the integral size by powers of two only, and it will return
	      the scaling factor (new_is/old_is) to the calling macro.

   Arguments: "size" (optional) is the size of the maximum integral in mm.
	      "neg_size" (optional) is the desired size of the largest negative
		integral.
	      "scalingfactor" is the ratio of the new integral size versus the
		old value.

    Examples: isadj
	      isadj(100)
	      isadj(100,100)
	      isadj2(50):r1
