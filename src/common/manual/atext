text		-	display the text of the current experiment
text(string)	-	set the text of the current experiment to string
ctext		-	clear the text of the current experiment
atext(string)   -       append string to the current experiment text
******************************************************************************
  Each experiment has associated with it a text file, which consists of a
  block of text which may describe the sample and experiment. The command
  "text" itself will display the text file in the current experiment.
  "text(string)" allows entry of new text. Two backslash characters "\\" or
  "\n" can be used in the string to denote a new line. The two character
  combination "\t" can be used to denote a tab. "ctext" can be used to clear
  the current text file.  atext adds a single line of text to the current
  experiment text file.  The vi command can also be used to edit the text file
  of the current experiment:
                vi(curexp+'/text')
  "text" also returns the text in a string variable.
  Therefore
     		text:n1 text(n1+'cosy experiment') 
  where "n1" is a string, could be used in a macro to add to the text.
  An equivalent operation using atext would be
                atext('cosy experiment')
