 nm2d - Automatic 2D normalization (M)
*******************************************************************************


      Syntax: nm2d<(noisemult)>

 Description: Sets up parameters "th" and "vs" automatically for a
	      2D contour plot and color map display.
	      nm2d measures the highest signal in the spectrum and sets "vs2d"
	      so that the highest signal is in the range of the highest color
	      level. It then calculates the noise threshold so that the number
	      of points above the noise threshold is between 10% and 30% of all 
	      the points. At the same time, the difference between the mean 
	      value of all the points above the threshold (peak ponits) and the 
	      mean value of all the points under the threshold (noise ponits)
	      is maximized. This noise threshold is then multiplied with a
	      noise multiplier that defaults to 4 for 1H, 19F and 31P (high
	      dynamic range nuclei) and homonuclear spectra in general. For
	      other spectra (hetcor, 2D-INADEQUATE) the default noise multi-
	      plier is 2. The noise multiplier can be altered with an optional
	      argument (minimum value: 1.5, entering lower values sets the
	      noise multiplier to 1.5). If the multiplied noise threshold is below
	      th=1, vs2d is scaled up, otherwise th is increased to the desired
	      level.
	      nm2d works both with absolute value and phase-sensitive spectra,
	      "trace" can be set to f1 or f2.
	      Hints: For hmqc/hsqc type spectra noise multipliers of 3 - 5
		     (default:4) are often more adequate; for "quick & dirty"
		     cosy spectra with lots of t1 noise and other artifacts
		     noise multipliers of 8 and higher may be adequate in
		     order to suppress the artifacts. For 2D-INADEQUATE spectra
		     noise levels below 3 are appropriate in order to catch
		     signals right above the noise level.

   Arguments: "noisemult" can be specified to alter the noise multiplier that
		is used within "nm2d" to adjust the threshold.
