autoq -  utility commands for the automation queue
*************************************************************************

autoq('add',pathname)
   adds the sampleinfo file at pathname to the
   automation queue (enterQ). The pathname may
   contain multiple sampleinfo entries.
   An implicit lock is placed on the queue.
   An autosa / autora pair is not needed.

autoq('add',pathname,'priority')
   adds the sampleinfo file at pathname to the
   automation queue (enterQ) with queue name
   'priority'.  The pathname may contain multiple
   sampleinfo entries. For the enterQ, 'priority' is
   interpreted as adding it to the top of the file.
   An implicit lock is placed on the queue.
   An autosa / autora pair is not needed.

autoq('lock')
   locks the automation queue (enterQ) so other
   processes can not access it.

autoq('lock',seconds)
   locks the automation queue (enterQ) so other
   processes will not access it.  By default, all
   locks expire after 5 seconds. A second argument
   can set the expiration time between 1 and 15 seconds.

autoq('unlock')
   removes the lock.

autoq('get',pathname)
   gets the next sampleinfo file from the automation
   queue (enterQ) and places it at pathname.
   An implicit lock is placed on the queue.
   An autosa / autora pair is not needed.
   This option will generally not be needed by user
   macros. This function is currently performed by
   Autoproc. 

autoq('sendmsg',message)
   Send "message" to whatever Vnmr session is listening.
   This is often used by background automation if it wants
   to send a message to a foreground Vnmr.

autoq('recvmsg','on')
   Turn on receiving messages from an autoq('sendmsg',message)
   command

autoq('recvmsg','off')
   Turn off receiving messages from an autoq('sendmsg',message)
   command

autoq('addAcct',pathname)
   adds the logging information contained in the file at pathname
   to the accounting file.  An implicit lock is placed on the
   accounting file.
