************************************************************************
*  getht    -    Retrieve/Save a Hadamard frequency list from a file.  *
************************************************************************

The getht macro is used to retrieve a Hadamard frequency line list
from a file, and sets the Hadamard parameters in an experiment.
It may also be used to save a Hadamard frequency line list from
the current experiment into a file.  

Usage for retrieving: getht(<'htfrq1' <,'htbw1'>>)

  If there is no first argument, htfrq1 is used as the Hadamard
    frequency parameter.
  If there is no second argument, htbw1 is used as the Hadamard
    bandwidth, if the bandwidth is specified in the file.

  In this usage, the macro retrieves the Hadamard frequency line
    list from a file in the current workspace directory, and sets
    the parameter values.  It also shows the parameters in the
    Line List display in the Edit HT Freq dialog (editht macro),
    if open.  The file to be copied is in curexp, e.g.

        /export/home/vnmr1/vnmrsys/exp1/htfrq1.ll

Usage for saving: getht(<'save' <,'htfrq1'>>)

  If the first argument is 'save', the Hadamard frequency list is 
    copied from the Edit HT Freq line list display to the current
    workspace directory.
  If there is no second argument, htfrq1 is used as the Hadamard
    frequency parameter name.  If a second argument is specified,
    it is used as the Hadamard frequency parameter name for
    the save file, e.g. getht('save','htfrq2') saves the file
    curexp + '/htfrq2.ll'.


File format: 

  The format of the file is the same as the Line List display
  in the Edit HT Freq dialog.  

  The first line is an optional title, specifying:
    frequency [units]  bandwidth [units]

    frequency units are Hz or ppm.  
      Units of Hz are measured from center of spectrum for Hadamard
        frequencies.  The units label is set to [Hz from center].
      Units of ppm are referenced to the current spectrum in the
        experiment.  In a 1D, it is referenced to the direct
        acquisition dimension.  In a 2D, it is referenced to F1.
    bandwidth units are assumed to be in Hz.  

  The second and subsequent lines are a list of frequencies and
  bandwidths.  The bandwidth column is optional, and assumed to be
  20 Hz (or the current value of htbw1) if not specified.

  Example #1: 
               freq [Hz from center]
                1172.37
                 327.69
                -346.37
               -1292.10

  In Example #1, the Hadamard frequencies are in Hz from the
  center of the spectrum.  

  Example #2:
               freq [ppm]     bw [Hz]
                7.930         20
                5.819         16
                4.134         20
                1.770         20

  In Example #2, the Hadamard frequencies are in ppm,
  referenced to the current spectrum.  The frequency bandwidth
  is set to 20 Hz for most of the frequencies, except for the
  second frequency, which is set to 16 Hz. 


Parameters used:
htfrq1  - Hadamard frequency list in indirect dimension, in ppm
            or Hz from center of spectrum.
htbw1   - Hadamard bandwidth in indirect dimension, in Hz.  It
            may be a single value or a list of values for each
            element in the htfrq1 list.  
tn      - nucleus used for frequency list.
