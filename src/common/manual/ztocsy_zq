Pulse sequence:
ztocsy_zq - z-TOCSY with optional ZQ suppression
  ref: M.J. Trippleton and J. Keeler;
             Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2003, 42 3938-3941.

Parameters:
	sspul	- flag for optional GRD-90-GRD steady state block
	gzlvl0	- gradient power level for sspul
	gt0	- gradient duration for sspul
	satmode	- flag for optional presaturation
	satdly  - presaturation delay
	satpwr	- presaturation power level
	satfrq	- presaturation frequency
	mix	- duration of the DIPSI-2 mixing along Z
                  (the pulse witdth and the corresponding power level
                   are internally calculated from strength and compH)
        strength- amplitufe of the B1 mixing field (in Hz)
        compH   - 1H amplifier compression factor
	gt1	- homospoil gradient duration after mixing
	gzlvl1	- homospoil gradient level after mixing
        gstab   - gradient stabilization delay
	zqflg	- optional flag for ZQ suppression !!
                  The shaped pulses and gradient powers are
                  calculated on-the-fly.
	alt_grd	- alternate gradient sign(s) in ZQ-filter on even transients
 The parameters: gcal_local, coil_size and h1freq_local necessary
 for ZQ suppression are taken from the probe file by the setup macro or
 calculated automatically.
 The parameter swfactor controling the width of the frequency range to be
 refocused for the ZQ filter is defaulted to 9.0 in the pulse sequence (as
 recommended by the literature reference).
 On the other hand, for very wide spectral windows the inversion range is
 limited to 60 kHZ to prevent dangerously high gradient levels to be set.
