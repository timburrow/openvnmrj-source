appdirs -  Editor for Applications directories
*******************************************************************************

An application directory is a directory where VnmrJ can look for templates,
maclib, manual, menujlib, parlib, probes, seqlib, shims, tablib, shapelib,
gshimlib, and mollib directories.  It will not look for expN directories,
global, psg, psglib, or other files or directories.  The exists
command has been enhanced to search for other files and directories in
the applications directories, allowing users flexibility to customize
their applications.

The appdirs macro brings up an editor to set the applications directories.
The top section of the editor has rows consisting of a menu and two entry boxes.
The menu selects between
  Enabled
  Disabled
  Remove(d)

Every other row is initially set to Remove(d) and the corresponding
entry boxes are empty.  This allows one to add new applications directories
between existing ones.  Note that the order in which applications directories
are searched is from the first row to the last row. To add a new application
directory, select which row you want to use, set the menu to Enable and enter
the path name of the directory in the first box.  A comment can be added
to the second entry box.

To temporarily enable or disable an application directory, set the menu
appropriately.  To completely remove an application directory, set its
menu to Remove(d)

The bottom section of the editor provides some radio-button choices.
The default choice is
  Save as private applications directories
This choice will change the applications directories for the current operator only.

Another choice is
  Reset to system default applications directories
This choice will remove any private applications directories, thereby reverting back
the the standard default set.

A third choice is available only to those with write permission for VnmrJ system files,
This choice will save the applications directories for global use. A name must be provided
for this choice. This will affect all users for whom the administrator has set
that name as their appdir setting. The Varian default names are Experimental, Walkup,
Imaging, and LcNmrMs.

At the very bottom of the editor are an OK and Cancel button. Exit the editor by pressing
one of these. Pressing the OK button will activate the selections made in the editor.
Selecting the Cancel button will abort the editor session, making no changes to the
applications directories.
