crl	- clear the reference line
crl1	- clear reference line along the first indirectly detected dimension
crl2	- clear reference line along the second indirectly detected dimension
rl      - set reference line
rl1     - set reference line along the first indirectly detected dimension
rl2     - set reference line along the second indirectly detected dimension

  The "crl", "crl1", and "crl2" commands clear frequency referencing
  along individual frequency axes.
  "crl"  sets the directly detected dimension's reference parameters
         "rfl" and "rfp" to zero.  Also resets the referencing
         parameters refpos and reffrq.
  "crl1" sets the first indirect dimension reference parameters
         "rfl1" and "rfp1" to zero.  Also resets the referencing
         parameters refpos1 and reffrq1.
  "crl2" sets the second indirect dimension reference parameters
         "rfl2" and "rfp2" to zero.  Also resets the referencing
         parameters refpos2 and reffrq2.

  The "rl", "rl1", and "rl2" commands set frequency referencing
  along individual frequency axes according to the current cursor
  position along each dimension.  These referencing commands take into
  account any frequency scaling with the scalesw, scalesw1 or scalesw2
  parameters.
  "rl"  sets the direct dimension reference line according to the cursor
        position "cr".
  "rl1" sets the first indirect dimension reference line according to
        the cursor position "cr1".
  "rl2" sets the second indirect dimension reference line according to
        the cursor position "cr2".

examples:
   rl(7.2p)        set current cursor position "cr" to 7.2 ppm
   rl2(0)          set current cursor position "cr2" to 0 Hz
