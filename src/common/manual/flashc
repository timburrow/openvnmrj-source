flashc	- convert compressed 2D data to standard 2D format
****************************************************************************

Applicability:	Generally used for imaging, but can be used for any 
		application needing this type of data conversion.

Syntax:		flashc<(<'nf'><,'ms'|'mi'|'rare'<,traces><,echoes>)>

Description:	Rearranges 2D "fid" data files from compressed formats to 
		standard format or from standard format to compressed format.  
		Compressed data is taken using the "nf" parameter to specify 
		the number of fids in the second dimension of a 2D experiment.
		In other words compressed data is acquired as one large 
		uninterrupted "multifid" acquisition.

		Before the 6.0 release, arrayed or multislice compressed
		images (seqcon='nscnn'), had to be reformatted to a 
		standard 2D format, using "flashc" before a "ft2d" could 
		be performed on the data.  Now using "ft2d('nf',<index>)" 
		this is no longer necessary, and processing time may even 
		be enhanced by reformatting data from the standard format 
		(seqcon='ncsnn') to the compressed format.  However for 
		compressed compressed 2D (seqcon='nccnn'), "flashc(...)" or 
		"flashc('nf',...)" must be run.

		For 3D data sets "flashc" is not needed.  The "ft3d" 
		routine will handle standard, compressed (seqcon='nncsn'), 
		or compressed-compressed (seqcon='nnccn') 3D data.

		The 'flashc' command reads the file "fid" in the "acqfil"
		subdirectory of the current experiment.  The data is 
		reordered and written back out to the same "fid" file.
		Thus, the original "fid" file is lost.  Precautions are 
		taken so that in the event of an error during processing, 
		the original "fid" file will be preserved.  Also, before
		running a simple check is done by 'flashc' to prevent it 
		from being executed more than once in an experiment on the 
		same data set.  The simple check against multiple executions 
		of 'flashc' looks for the parameter 'flash_converted'
		which "flashc" creates when it is run.  To rerun "flashc"
		the parameter can be removed with the following commands:
			destroy('flash_converted')
			destroy('flash_converted','processed')



		Compressed-compressed or Standard to Compressed Format
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

		Using "ft2d('nf',<index>)", "flashc" really only has to
		be used to convert a completely compressed multislice, 
		multiecho, or multi-image sequence.  However, for a large 
		standard multi-slice experiment (seqcon='ncsnn') a 
		performance benefit may be achieved in converting the data
		to a compressed format.  When converting to a compressed
		format the first argument must always be 'nf'.  When
		converting completely compressed or "rare"
		type sequences, the first argument is a string defining the 
		type of compression. This string can either be 'ms' for
		multislice, 'mi' for multi-image, or 'rare' for multi-echo
		"rare" type fast imaging data sets.  The second argument 
		defines the number of images slices or array elements to 
		retain.

		The values of four VNMR parameters are changed by "flashc".
		o "ni" is set to 1 if no argument is provided.
		o "nf" is set to the value of "nf" divided by the multislice
		  "ms" or multi-image "mi" value.
		o "arraydim" is set to the product of its original value and 
		  the value of the "traces" argument.
		o "arrayelemts" is set to 1 if no parameters were arrayed 
		  during data acquisition or to 2 if any parameter was 
		  arrayed during data acquisition.

Examples:	flashc('nf')        standard to compressed 
		flashc('nf','ms',ns)  compressed phase-encode and multi-slice
		flashc('nf','mi',ns)  compressed multi-image and phase-encode


		Compressed to Standard Format
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		"flashc" can convert a completely compressed multislice, 
		multiecho, or multi-image sequence.  It can also convert
		a "rare" type sequence with a compressed phase-encode echo
		train.	When converting completely compressed or "rare"
		type sequences, the first argument is a string defining the 
		type of compression. This string can either be 'ms' for
		multislice, 'mi' for multi-image, or 'rare' for multi-echo
		"rare" type fast imaging data sets.  The second argument 
		defines the number of compressed traces to retain for each 
		"ni" and "nf" will be set to this number after "flashc" has 
		been run.

		The values of four VNMR parameters are changed by "flashc".
		o "nf" is set to the value of the "traces" argument, or to 
		  1 if no argument is provided.
		o "ni" is set to the value of "nf" divided by the multislice
		  "ms" or multi-image "mi" value.
		o "arraydim" is set to the product of its original value and 
		  the original value of "nf".
		o "arrayelemts" is set to 1 if no parameters were arrayed 
		  during data acquisition or to 2 if any parameter was 
		  arrayed during data acquisition.

Examples:	flashc              simple compressed phase-encode
		flashc('ms',ns)     compressed phase-encode and multi-slice
		flashc('mi',ns)     compressed multi-image and phase-encode
		flashc('rare',ns,etl)
