dtext    display a text file in the graphics window

Syntax:	  dtext<('Filename')> <:$x,$y,$dy>
          dtext<(x,y)> <:$x,$y,$dy>
          dtext<('Filename',x,y)> <:$x,$y,$dy>

Description: Display a text file in the graphics window.  With no
             arguments,  dtext displays the current experiment text
             file in the upper left hand corner of the screen.  If
             some other text file is to be displayed,  its pathname
             may be supplied as the first argument to dtext.  Positioning
             of the output can be controlled by passing x and y coordinates.
             The macro dtext will return to a calling macro the
             x and y position of where the start of the next line
             would have been displayed.  The y increment between lines
             is also returned.

Examples: dtext               - display exp. text file at default position
          dtext(filename)     - display filename at default position
          dtext(x,y)          - display exp. text file at position x,y
          dtext(filename,x,y) - display filename at position x,y
          dtext:$x,$y,$dy     - display exp. text file at default position
                                 and return x and y and delta-y positions
                                 for subsequent character plotting.
