makedosyparams

This macro is run automatically when a new-style DOSY pulse sequence
is run.  It stores the correct values of dosyfrq (the Larmor frequency
of the diffusion-encoded nucleus) and dosytimecubed (the time cubed
factor in the expression for diffusional attenuation), creating the
parameters if necessary.

makedosyparams should not normally need to be run manually;  if it is
run, it takes the values of dosytimecubed and dosyfrq as arguments.
