*******************************************************************************
These commands put the Mercury or GEMINI 2000 console in the tune mode.
A `su' command may be necessary to select the desired frequency. Each 
command turns a particular channel on, and about 1/2 Watt of rf is 
directed to the proper probe coil. Remember to move the proper cable on
the back of the left hand magnet leg to the BNC labeled TUNE, and also
to move the proper cable leading to the probe to the BNC labeled TUNE. 
After the probe is tuned type `tuneoff' to take the console out of tune mode.

These commands cannot be executed while the console is acquiring or 
interactive acquisition (`acqi') is connected.
