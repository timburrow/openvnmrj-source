snapshot<:$path> - Save a screen capture

The snapshot macro takes a screen capture and saves the result in the users vnmrsys/print
directory. This macro is controlled by the printregion and printformat global parameters.

The printregion parameter can be set to 'graphics' to do a screen capture of the graphics
area of the VnmrJ interface. It can be set to 'vnmrj' to do a screen capture of the
entire VnmrJ interface. 

The printformat can be set to 'png', 'gif', or 'jpg' to store the screen capture
in the respective formats.

The screen capture file will be saved the the users vnmrsys/print directory with a name
based on the template operator+'_%DATE%_%TIME%%R0%.' See the man page for Svfname for a
description of the template.

The snapshot macro will display the name of the file to which the screen shot is saved.
If an optional return value is requested, the file name is returned to the calling
macro and is not displayed.

Example
 snapshot   // Do a screen capture based on current values of printformat and printregion
