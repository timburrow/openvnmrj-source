The commands ph2, av2, and pwr2 operate by setting the parameter dmg2
to a particular value.  ph2 sets dmg2 = 'ph2'; av2, dmg2 = 'av2'; and
pwr2, dmg2 = 'pwr2'.  If the parameter dmg2 does not exist, each of
these commands will create it and set it to the appropriate string
value.  These commands are only needed if mixed-mode displays are
desired.  If the parameter dmg2 does not exist or it is set to '',
then the display mode along F2 will be the same as that along F3.
In other words,  if dmg2 does not exist or is set to the null string,
the parameter dmg will be used to define the display mode along F2.

In the phased mode, which is selected by ph2, each real point in the
displayed F2 trace is calculated from a linear combination of the REAL
and IMAGINARY points comprising each respective F2 complex data point.
For hypercomplex data, the linear combination uses the REAL-REAL and
IMAGINARY-REAL points from each respective F2 hypercomplex data point.
The coefficients for this linear combination are derived from the phase
parameters "rp2" and "lp2".

In the absolute value mode, which is selected by av2, each real point
in the displayed F2 trace is calculated as the square root of the sum
of the squares of the REAL and IMAGINARY points comprising each respec-
tive F2 complex data point.  For hypercomplex data, the REAL-REAL and
IMAGINARY-REAL points from each respective F2 hypercomplex data point
are used in the summation.  In this mode, all information, including
noise, is always positive; and the relationship between signal and noise
is linear.

In the power mode, which is selected by pwr2, each real point in the
displayed F2 trace is calculated as the sum of the squares of the REAL
and IMAGINARY points comprising each respective F2 complex data point.
For hypercomplex data, the REAL-REAL and IMAGINARY-REAL points from
each respective F2 hypercomplex data point are used in the summation.
In this mode, all information, including noise, is always positive; and
the relationship between signal and noise is non-linear.

For the contour display of 2D data, the result of the commands ph2, av2,
and pwr2 are the same as for F2 traces provided that pmode = 'partial' or
pmode = ''.
