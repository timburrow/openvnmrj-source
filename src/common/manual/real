string	- 	create a unset string variable
*******************************************************************************

  These command creates real and string variables without values.  
  It is similar to the create command.  These commands were used to 
  force the type of temporary variables in macros.  Normally the
  type of a temporary variables is automatically set upon first 
  assignment of a value to the variable.  If it is a string value,
  then the temporary variable is assigned string type.  If it is a
  real, then it is assigned real type.  In the past, we allowed
  operations with mixed real and string variables and needed this
  command to force the type of the variable.  However, we no longer
  allow mixed operations of real and string types.  Thus probably there 
  is no longer a need for these two commands.  They have not
  been removed yet just in case this is not true.
  
  Usage  -  real('variablename')
