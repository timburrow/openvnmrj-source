*******************************************************************************
setfrq          -  set the frequencies for all the rf channels in the system
setfrq(number)  -  set the frequency for all the requested rf channel
setfrq(nucleus) -  display or return the frequency of the supplied nucleus
*******************************************************************************

The command setfrq will calculate frequencies based on nucleus (tn, dn, 'C13', etc),
referencing (lockfreq), solvent, and, except when a nucleus is supplied, the offset
parameter (tof, dof, etc).  The result of the calculation will be stored in
parameters sfrq, dfrq, dfrq2, etc., or returned to the calling macro.

setfrq with no argument will calculate frequencies for all rf channels.  setfrq with
a single integer argument will set the frequency for that rf channel.  setfrq with
a nucleus name as the argument will display or return the frequency for that nucleus.
For example, setfrq(2) will set dfrq. setfrq(2):r1 will set r1 to the frequency of
channel 2. If return arguments are used, setfrq will not set any parameters, only
return values to the calling macro. The frequencies will be rounded to the resolution
of that channel (either 0.1 Hz or 100 Hz).  If a nuclues name is supplied as an argument,
channel 1 is assumed for rounding information.  Also, if a nucleus name is supplied,
an offset (e.g., tof or dof) is not added to the result.

Whenever a parameter is entered which affects a frequency,  the setfrq command
will be called from the underscore macro (for example, _tn, _tof, _dn, _dof)
to recalculate the frequency for that channel.
Whenever a parameter is entered which affects all frequencies,  the setfrq command
will be called from the underscore macro (for example, _solvent, _lockfreq, _h1freq)
to recalculate all the frequencies.

The setfrq command should never need to be entered from the keyboard.
It will be called when the appropriate parameters are changed or a
parameter set is returned.
