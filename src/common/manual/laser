LASER:SVS adiabatic localization

To set all frequencies: Click on the "Set All Freq (Hz) " Button

Phase cycle: autoph='n', only phase cycles up to nt
             autoph='y' goes through nt*array
             pcflag='n' - turns off the phase cycle entirely
             
Central (Base) Frequency=resto-restol (or H1offset-restol)

Restol (Local offset) is a small offset 0 to ca. 20 Hz from the global frequency 
of the reference. If after clicking on "Set All Freq (Hz)", Local offset appears 
to be large, then H1offset is not calibrated correctly. 

For water suppression optimization:
sglarray=1;
sglpower=0;

For RF pulse tpwr array:
sglpower=1
