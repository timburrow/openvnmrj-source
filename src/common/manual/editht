*  editht        -        Create and edit a Hadamard frequency list.   *
************************************************************************

The editht macro opens the Edit HT Freq dialog, for interactively
creating and editing a Hadamard frequency line list.  

To set up a Hadamard experiment starting from a 1D experiment, do
the following.
  1) First run a Proton, Carbon, or other 1D experiment, depending
       on the type of Hadamard experiment you wish to run
       (homonuclear or heteronuclear).
  2) When the acquisition is finished, process and phase the
       spectrum.
  3) Run the editht macro to open the Edit HT Freq dialog.
       Create a Hadamard frequency list for the nucleus
       of interest.  Save the frequency list.
  4) For a heteronuclear Hadamard experiment, run a Proton
       experiment, and adjust spectral width and decoupling
       as desired.
  5) Load the desired Hadamard experiment.  Check the
       Hadamard frequency list and other parameters.
  6) Start the acquisition of the Hadamard experiment.
  7) When acquisition is complete, process with
       proc1='ht' wft2da.


How to use the Edit HT Freq dialog.

  To make a Hadamard frequency list from a 1D spectrum (step 3
  above), use the buttons in the Edit HT Freq dialog.  

  Create Line List :  Processes the current spectrum as follows.
    a) Fourier transform with wft.  Multiplet structures can be
       smoothed out using line broadening.  
    b) Create a line list using nll, greater than the current
       threshhold.  
    c) Keep only frequencies that are the minimum line width
       apart in the "Min line width" entry box (e.g. 20 Hz).  

  Nearest line : Place the cursor on the nearest line.
  Select       : Adds the current cursor position to the
                   line list.  (The cursor must be more than
                   the minimum line width from an existing
                   frequency in the line list.) 
  Remove       : Removes the line nearest the cursor position
                   from the line list. 
  Display      : Display the frequency list.  If a 1D spectrum
                   is displayed, show the frequencies using dpf
                   in units set by the axis parameter.
  CLEAR        : Clear all frequencies from the frequency list.

  Save HT Frequencies : Saves the current frequency list as a
    Hadamard line list for the current nucleus (tn).  It
    saves the frequency list, band width, current nucleus,
    spectral width, and frequency offset in a persistence
    file.  The frequencies and other parameters are loaded
    from the persistence file when loading a Hadamard experiment
    (step 5 above).

  Line List    : The line list is displayed in the text entry
    window on the right hand side of the page.  You may edit the
    line list directly from this window.  Click the 'Set list
    into parameters' button to set the line list changes into
    the parameters.  The first column of numbers is the Hadamard
    frequency list, e.g. htfrq1.  If there is a second column of
    numbers, it specifies the bandwidth for each frequency in Hz.  

  Hz/ppm menu  : Select Hz or ppm to display the line list in
    Hz or ppm.  If Hz is selected, the line list is displayed
    in Hz from the center of the spectrum.

  Move HT pars to exp  : Move the Hadamard parameters from the
    current workspace to a new workspace.  The workspace number
    is specified in the entry box.  

  Set list into parameters : Sets the changes from the line
    list text entry window into the parameters.

  Import list curexp / htfrq1.ll : Copies a line list file from
    curexp into the current line list, and sets the line list
    into the parameters.  The line list file to be copied is
    named after the frequency parameter, e.g.

      /export/home/vnmr1/vnmrsys/exp2/htfrq1.ll

    The format of the file is the same as the line list
    display.  

    Example #1: 
      freq [Hz from center]
       1172.37
        327.69
       -346.37
      -1292.10

    In Example #1, the Hadamard frequencies are in Hz from the
    center of the spectrum.  

    Example #2:
      freq [ppm]      bw [Hz]
       7.930          20
       5.819          16
       4.134          20
       1.770          20

    In Example #2, the Hadamard frequencies are in ppm, referenced
    to the current spectrum.  The bandwidth for each frequency is
    also specified as 16 Hz for the second frequency, and 20 Hz
    for the rest.  If htbw1 is arrayed to two or more values in
    the parameter set, the values are written to the line list file.
    If the size of the htbw1 array is smaller than the size of
    the htfrq1 array, the last value of htbw1 is applied to the
    remaining frequencies.  


  In a 2D display, the Edit HT Freq dialog may be used to
  view the Hadamard frequency list in F1.  Interactive
  frequency selection and display from the graphics window may
  be done.  You may also edit frequencies from the Line List window.
  In a 2D display, frequencies in ppm are referenced to F1.  


Parameters used:
htfrq1  - Hadamard frequency list in indirect dimension, in Hz
            from center of spectrum, or ppm.
htbw1   - Hadamard band width in indirect dimension, in Hz.  It
            may be a single value or a list of values for each
            element in the htfrq1 list.
tn      - nucleus used for frequency list.
