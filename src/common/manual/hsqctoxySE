hsqctoxySE.c - 	HSQC-TOCSY-3D	
	Features -	HSQC  is  "sensitivity enhanced" as per Rance et. al.
			TOCSY is "sensitivity enhanced" as per Rance et. al.
			dipsi or mlev-17 spinlock option (dipsiflg flag)
			F1 dimension can be band selected with shaped pulse
			 (use of shaped pulse will introduce a small
			 phase error along F1.  rp1 and lp1 values can be
			 obtained by examining first np x ni plane)
			Gradient to kill unwanted signals during H-X INEPT
			Water presaturation ON or OFF resonance

	Parameters:	phase=1,2,3,4 and phase2=1,2,3,4
			dm = 'nnyny' (ON during t2 and t3)

			f2coef = '1 0 0 1 1 0 0 -1 0 1 -1 0 0 -1 -1 0'
                        f1coef = '1 0 0 1 1 0 0 -1 0 1 -1 0 0 -1 -1 0'
			f1coef and f2coef are used by make3dcoef macro
			These are processing parameters
			
	Processing - There are many ways to process the first inc 2D's 
			and the 3D

2D coef:
       (Note 2D plane transforms cannot be done with the 3D datasets.
       ft2d can handle a maximum of only 8 datasets but ft3d can handle more)

 nixnp or ni2xnp (phase=1,2,3,4 or phase2=1,2,3,4):

	ft2d(<'ni2'>,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,-1,0,1,-1,0,0,-1,-1,0)

3D coef:
	Use make3dcoef macro to construct 3d coef table

        Alternatively, you can use the following coefficients.

	Phasing:
		rp  = rp(1D) - 90  	lp = lp(1D)
		rp1 = 90		lp1 = 0 (for hard pulse)
		(rp1 and lp1 will be non-zero for shaped pulse expt)
		rp2 = 90		lp2 = 0
