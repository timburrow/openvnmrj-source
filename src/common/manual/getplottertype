The getplottertype command retrieves plotter information
getplottertype:$rasterValue,$plotterType
getplottertype(plotter):$rasterValue,$plotterType
getplottertype(plotter,'osname'):$osname
getplottertype(plotter,'attr'):$attr
*******************************************************************************

The getplottertype command retrieves plotter information. With zero or one
argument, it will return the "raster" value from the devicetable file
and the "Type" value from the devicenames file. With no arguments, it uses
the value of the plotter parameter.
The returned raster values are:

0  -  Plotters which use the HPGL language.
1  -  Plotters which use the PCL language and are in portrait mode.
2  -  Plotters which use the PCL language and are in landscape mode.
3  -  Plotters which use the PostScript language and are in portrait mode.
4  -  Plotters which use the PostScript language and are in landscape mode.


The VnmrJ name for a plotter does not need to be the same name that the
computer operating system (OS) uses for the plotter / printer. The 
getplottertype with two arguments, where the first argument is the VnmrJ
plotter name and the second argument is the 'osname' keyword, will return
the plotter / printer name used by the OS.

If a plotter name is given as the first argument and a plotter attribute,
as listed in the devicetable, is the second argument, getplottertype
will return the value of the attribute. If the attribute does not exist,
a null string is returned.

Example:

  getplottertpye(plotter,'papersize'):$psize
