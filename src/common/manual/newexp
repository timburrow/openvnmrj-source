newexp:		create a new VNMR experiment

       Syntax:	newexp<:$num>

  Description:	newexp creates a new VNMR experiment which is used as a temporary
		work space and can hold a complete 1D, 2D, or 3D data set.
                The newexp macro will copy the "current" and "processed"
                parameter trees to the newly created experiment's
                curpar and procpar files.

                If the global 'newexpdir' parameter exists and is not the null
                string (''), and its value is the path name of an existing
                directory, the new experiment will be created in that directory.

                The newexp macro will return the number of the experiment it
                created.
              
    Arguments:	There are no arguments for newexp.
