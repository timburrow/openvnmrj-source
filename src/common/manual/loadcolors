loadcolors - load colors for graphics and plotters

loadcolors loads the color table for the display graphics and plotters.
If an argument is given, a macro of that name is looked for in the users
vnmr directory templates/vnmr. If it is not found there, it then looks
in the vnmr system directory user_templates/vnmr. The macro includes a
series of setcolor commands and is generated by the colors program.

If no argument is given, a color table with the same name as the value
of the plotter parameter is searched for in the same two directories.
If the macro is found, the colors will be loaded.  On bootup, the bootup
macro calls loadcolors to set the plotter and graphics colors.
