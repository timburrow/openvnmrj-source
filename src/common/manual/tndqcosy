 tndqcosy -  2D J-correlation experiment
                TRANSMITTER SOLVENT SATURATION ONLY
                ASSUMES ON-RESONANCE SOLVENT (tof is at solvent position)

  satmode  determines when the saturation happens. Satmode should be set
            analogously to dm, i.e. satmode='yyn' or 'ynn' etc.
   satpwr = power level during saturation period(s)
   satdly = length of presaturation period (saturation may also occur
             in d2 as determined by satmode)
   sspul = 'y': selects for Trim(x)-Trim(y) sequence at start of pulse sequence
              (recommended)

   (requires system with linear amplifier on observe channel and T/R switch)

NOTE: the tndqcosy pulse sequence is not supplied with Mercury and GEMINI 2000.
