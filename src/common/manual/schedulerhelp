1.) Enter a name for the shimming study in Samplename field.

2.) In the entry for Position enter the location for the 
lineshape sample.

3.) Choose desired proshim method from ShimMethod menu:
LongLineshape submits a lineshape spectrum which is Z-PFG-shimmed
This is followed by the proshim method "allshim" after which
a final lineshape experiment with additional Z-PFG shim is performed.


FastLineshape just does xyz_extended method  with Z-PFG shim at each step.

Lineshape simply acquires a lineshape spectrum with only Z-PFG shim.

Solvent is typically acetone-d6 but a menu is provided for this purpose.
Note that solvent will be set at the current value in the workspace
when the shim_scheduler tool is evoked.

Clicking the green Create button saves a CSV spreadsheet in a 
directory called csvlib inside of the local vnmrsys directory.
The name of the CSV file is Shim.csv. 

Select the day for shim service from the menu.
Enter the desired hour for shim to occur - 24 hour format: eg 0 to 23.
Enter the desired minute for shim - 01 to 59.
Click the green Schedule button and the console processes with be
told to shim at the specified time.

Shimming can be scheduled for more times as desired by setting
another day and time and clicking Schedule.  It IS NOT necessary
to re-create the Shim.csv simply to schedule. Once it is place in
the csvlib directory, it is ready to use as desired.

Clicking the Cancel button will cancel all scheduled shimming.

In short, once the Shim.csv is in place the act of scheduling shim
maintenance and/or canceling and rescheduling can be done just by
using the bottom portion of this scheduler popup.
