INADEQUATE: Carbon-carbon connectivity using double quantum spectroscopy;
            F1 quadrature is achieved by hardware small-angle phaseshifts

PARAMETERS

  pw      : 90 degree carbon pulse
  jcc     : carbon carbon coupling constant in hz
  phase   :   0: absolute value with F1 quadrature
            1,2: hypercomplex method (phase-sensitive, F1 quadrature)
              3: TPPI method (phase-sensitive, F1 quadrature)
  nt = min:  multiple of   8 (phase=0)
             multiple of   4 (phase=1,2  phase=3)
       max:  multiple of 128 (phase=0)
             multiple of  64 (phase=1,2  phase=3)

NOTE:  Data acquired with phase=0 should be processed with wft2d.  Data
       acquired with phase=1,2 or phase=3 should be processed with wft2da.
       If phase-sensitive data without F1 quadrature are desired, set phase=1
       and process with wft2da.

       For 1D spectra, set phase=1 for maximum sensitivity.
