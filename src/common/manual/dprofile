      Syntax: dprofile<(axisflag<,profile<,shapefile>>)>
	      dprofile<(profile<,axisflag<,shapefile>>)>
	      pprofile<(axisflag<,profile<,shapefile>>)>
	      pprofile<(profile<,axisflag<,shapefile>>)>

 Description: dprofile displays the X, Y and Z excitation (inversion) profile
	      for a pulse shape that has been generated with the Pbox software.
              If shape name is not provided, the last simulation data stored
              in shapelib/pbox.sim are displayed. See also man('Pbox').
	      pprofile does the same thing as dprofile, except that the output
	      is on the plotter.

   Arguments: axisflag - 'y' also displays the full spectrum and a frequency
		scale; 'n' suppresses scale and spectrum (default).
	      profile - 'xyz' selects X, Y, and Z (inversion) profiles
		(default); 'xy' only selects the excitation (transverse)
		profiles; 'x' only selects the X transverse excitation
		profile; 'z' only selects the inversion profile
              shapefile - *.RF or *.DEC type files.
	      The first two arguments can be given in any order.
