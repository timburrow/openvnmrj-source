Dosy3DTab - Diffusion-ordered 3D experiment Family.

Information Conveyed - 2D connectivity experiments acquired as 3D experiments with
one axis being diffusion rates.

All experiments in this tab basically produce 3D data where the F3 dimension is the
detected nucleus and F1 and F2 dimensions are the diffusion rate and a traditional 2D
such as COSY or HSQC.  As such it has the potential to separate mixtures of compounds
by their relative sizes and at the same time obtain 2D NMR data for each component in
the mixture.
