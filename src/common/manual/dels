  "dll" displays a list of line frequencies and amplitudes that are
  above a threshold defined by the parameter "th".  The frequency units
  displayed are determined by the parameter "axis".  dll('pos') lists only
  positive lines.  dll(noisemult) will suppress noise peaks on broad, noisy
  peaks.  The default value of noisemult is 3.  A smaller value will result
  in more peaks, a larger value will result in fewer peaks, and a value of
  0.0 will result in a line listing containing all peaks above the threshold.
  Negative values of noisemult default to 3.  The results of dll are stored
  in the parameters "llfrq" and "llamp".  The frequencies are stored as hertz
  and are not referenced to "rfl" and "rfp".  The amplitudes are stored as the
  actual data point value; they are not scaled by "vs".  The number of lines
  can be returned to the caller if the command is suffixed with a colon and
  parameter names. A scaling factor for line amplitudes can be returned as
  a second variable.  This scaling factor accounts for vs and whether the
  lines are listed in absolute intensity mode or normalized mode.

  "nll" is equivalent to "dll" except that the line list is not displayed
  or printed.  The results are stored in the parameters "llfrq" and "llamp".

  "getll" finds the height and frequency of nth line.  It assumes a
  previous "dll". The value of the height and frequency of the specified
  line can be returned to the caller if the command is suffixed with
  a colon and parameter names.

  "nl" moves the cursor to the nearest calculated line position.
  Optional arguments return height and frequency of the line.

  "nl2" moves the right cursor to the nearest calculated line position.
  It adjusts the delta parameter, not the cr parameter.
  Optional arguments return height and frequency of the line. To calculate
  delta, take cr - <returned frequency>.

  "fp", following a line listing (either "dll" or "nll"), will measure
  either the height (default) or phase (if the 'phase' option is specified)
  of each peak in an array of spectra.  If optional line indexes are supplied
  as arguments, only the heights or phases of the corresponding lines will
  be measured.  "fp" produces a text file 'fp.out' in the current experiment
  directory, which contains the result of the analysis.
  If the parameter "npoint" is defined in the current parameter set and
  this parameter is "on", it determines the range of data points over
  which a maximum is searched when determining peak heights.  The possible
  values of "npoint" are 1 to fn/4.  The default is 2.

  "dels(index1,...)" deletes the spectra selected by the indexes from
  the output file of "fp", 'fp.out', used by the "t1" 
  or "t2" analysis.  Spectra may be restored by rerunning "fp".
