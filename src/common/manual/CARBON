CARBON: Experiment using the s2pul pulse sequence set to acquire a 13C 1D dataset

The parameter set called PROTON is special in that it is the building block for
most common liquids NMR small molecule experiments. The default of course is for the
parameter tn (transmitter nucleus) to be set to C13. The parameter dn (decoupler nucleus)
is set to H1 because that is the most likely "other" spin involved.  Either of these
parameters may be changed to any legal value as desired.

The loading of this parameter set is assisted by the application-type (apptype) macro
called std1D.  If a user desires a specific customization of the setup process this
is most conveniently achieved by the creation of a macro called userCARBON.

The creation of a macro called CARBON_plot would mean that automatic plotting would
proceed using the macro by that name.

On the Acquire->default panel there are convenient menu selections to easily convert
the default 1H-decoupled + nOe 13C spectrum into a 1D 13C with or without 1H decoupling
and or nOe effect.

The Default Panel for CARBON also contains a very useful tool to define both a region
and a value for signal to noise evaluation. Using this tool an operator can setup an
open-ended long CARBON and tell the experiment in automation to check the obtained
signal to noise in a specific region at the interval in scans defined by the bs (block
size) parameter.
