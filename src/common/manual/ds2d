pl2d<(Options)>	 -	Plot 2-D Spectra in "Whitewash" Mode
*******************************************************************************

  A stacked plot of 2D spectra in which traces in front "block" the view to
  traces behind them (known as "whitewashing") is produced with "ds2d". Color
  does not represent intensity (unlike "dcon"), since intensity can be seen
  visually, but instead successive traces are displayed in different colors
  so that color represents frequency. Certain options are available.
  ds2d('nobase') activates the th parameter to suppress all intensity below
  th. ds2d('fill') fills in the peaks. ds2d('fillnb') combines base suppression
  and peak filling.  ds2d('noww') suppresses whitewashing.  The 'nobase',
  'fill', 'fillnb', and 'noww' options are mutually exclusive.  Another
  optional argument which can be used either alone or in combination with one
  of the above options is 'noaxis'.  This option omits outlining the display
  (or plot) and omits drawing the horizontal and vertical axes.
