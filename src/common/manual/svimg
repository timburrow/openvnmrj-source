******************************************************************************
svimg 		Generate and Save images as FDF files. 	(macro)
******************************************************************************

Applicability:	Systems with Imaging Module.

Format: svimg('directory_name'[,'outfmt'])

Description:	
	The "svimg" command generates images from the current experiment 
	and saves them into the specified directory as Flexible Data 
	Format (fdf) files.  It will save one image or a number of images
	in the case of multislice experiments. 

	Currently the specified directory is made in the user's data 
	directory, and will be appended with a ".dat".  Image files will 
	be created under this directory as "image0001.fdf", "image0002.fdf", 
	and so on.  A "procpar" file will also be saved into this directory.

	The 'outfmt' parameter is an optional character which defines the
	type of image data.  It can take two character values:
	'f' - Outputs the data in floating point format.  
	'm' - Outputs the data in 12 bit integer values in 16 bit words.
	The default is 'f' (floating point) and currently ImageBrowser only
	accepts data in floating point values.
	
	The macro only saves images with the new imaging parameters that
	support oblique imaging.  Unlike "svsis" the macro does not care
	about the name of the sequence.  It does however format the
	header according to the following parameters.
 
        seqcon          - Sequence loop control flag
	nD		- Data dimension assumed to be 2.

        tn,dm           - Transmitter Nucleus (string)
        sfrq,dfrq       - Spectrometer frequency (MHz)

        lro             - Size of FOV for read out axis (cm)
        lpe             - Size of FOV for phase encode axis (cm)
        pro             - Position of image center on the read out axis (cm)
        ppe             - Position of image center on 2D phase encode 
                          axis (cm)

        thk             - Slice thickness (mm)
        pss             - Slice position (cm)

	psi,phi,theta	- Euler angles determining direction.

	The macro uses a Vnmr command "svsdfd" to dump the transformed
	data out to the data file. After dumping the headers out a unix
	shell command "fdfgluer" is called to glue the headers to the
	data.  The "svsdfd" command dumps the data in such a way that the 
	(0,0) coordinates are the first data point in the file.


	NOTES: Modifications to the macro should be made in the user's
	       maclib.

	       The output values of the direction cosines may not be correct.
