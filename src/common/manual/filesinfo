The filesinfo is designed to allow access to the list of files selected from
the files display.

An argument of 'number' returns the number of entries selected, or 0 if none
have been selected.

An argument of 'name' returns the names of the selected entries.  If it is
followed by a number i, only the name of the ith entry is returned.

An agument of 'redisplay' causes the current contents of the directory to be
displayed.  It is useful when one has made changes - deleting or creating a
file - in the directory.

The filesinfo command is normally only used by the macros that implement the
menu functions of the file system.  It will not execute unless the files
command is active.  Typically the user does not enter this command from the
keyboard.
