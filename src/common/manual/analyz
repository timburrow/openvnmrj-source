$option ='n' for amplitude and phase, 'a' for amplitude only, and 'p' for
phase only.  The $title option puts a title on the plot.

Example 

analyz      Does analysis for both amplitude and phase

analyz('p')   Does analysis for phase only

analyz('n','Stability')  Does analysis for amplitude and phase and puts title
                       "Stability" on the plot.
