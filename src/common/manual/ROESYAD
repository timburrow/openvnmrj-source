PARAMETERS

  sspul   : y - selects magnetization randomization option 
  PFGflg  : y - selects G-90-G method for magnetization randomization
  hsglvl  : Homospoil gradient level (DAC units)
  hsgt    : Homospoil gradient time
  satmode : y - selects presaturation during relax delay
            Options for presat, purge presat, or wet during relaxation delay or mix time.
            Flipback pulse for water also supported prior to observe pulse.
  satfrq  : Presaturation frequency
  satdly  : Presaturation delay
  satpwr  : Presaturation power
  mixR    : ROESY spinlock mixing time
  slpwrR  : Spin-lock power level
  slpwR   : 90 deg pulse width for spinlock
            ROESY Tilt Angle easily adjustable on pulse sequence panel.
  d1	  : Relaxation delay
  d2	  : Evolution delay
