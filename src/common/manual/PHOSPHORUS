PHOSPHORUS: Setup parameters for PHOSPHORUS  spectrum

By default 1H decoupling parameters are set to suppress nOe. (dm='nny' with the s2pul
pulse sequence). If the user desires a special setup step for 31P NMR this is easily
acheived by the creation of a local userPHOSPHORUS macro. A macro called PHOSPHORUS_plot
would define how routine 31P data would be plotted.
