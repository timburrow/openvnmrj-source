"trtune" allows the user to view multiple tuning traces
apparently simultaneously.  A tune sweep executes on tn
nucleus (typically H1),  then the dn nucleus, the dn2, 
and so on.  A color key is displayed to the right and 
above the axis on the display.  The # traces selection 
(the nf parameter) controls how many traces are performed, 
the maximum number of traces is the number of rf channels present.  
If probeConnect is present, it is used. If not, the channel order 
is '12345' if tn is highband, and '21345' otherwise.

There is only one vertical scale control.  The traces may be 
adjusted by independent gain control (gain, gaind, gaind2, gaind3 etc.) 
which are defined in the prarameter set.  The power may be adjusted 
independently as well (tupwr, tupwrd, tupwrd2 etc.)  It is preferable 
to keep power levels low, and adjust gain. 

Adjusting the display is easiest setting number of traces to 1 and autoscale.  

Trtune does not support shared RF channel nor does it support quadrature tuning.
