tempcal<('solvent')><:temp>	- Temperature Calculation
*************************************************************************

For exact determination of sample temperature when using the
variable temperature unit,  a temperature calibration curve must
be made for each probe used.  All data,  e.g., gas flow, must be
noted.  Samples of ethylene glycol or methanol are used for high-
and low- temperature calibration,  respectively.  After bringing
the sample to the desired temperature and allowing sufficient time
for equilibration,  obtain a spectrum.  Align the two cursors on
the two resonances in the spectrum,  then type tempcal('glycol'),
tempcal('e') or tempcal('g') for ethylene glycol or
tempcal('methanol') or tempcal('m') for methanol.  The temperature
will be calculated based on the difference frequency between the
cursors.  The temperature may be returned to an optional output
parameter or displayed.
