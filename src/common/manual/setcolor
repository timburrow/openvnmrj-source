setcolor	- 	set colors used by Vnmr
*******************************************************************************

  The setcolor command can set the colors used on the graphics screen
  and the colors used by the various plotters.  The general form of the
  command is setcolor(device, itemindex, color).  The device specifies
  what device the command will access.  Values of device include
  'graphics'	to control the colors displayed on the graphics screen
  'ps'		to control the colors of plotters using the PostScript language.
  'pcl'		to control the colors of plotters using the PCL language.
  'hpgl'	to control the colors of plotters using the HPGL language.
  'pen' 	to control the mapping of a color to a pen of
                   plotters using the HPGL language. See below.

  The itemindex is a digit which represents a specific drawing item. Examples
  include indexes for spectra, integrals, contour levels, etc. A complete
  table of the indexes is listed below. Note: PCL plotters are the laser
  type of plotter. HPGL plotters are the pen type of plotter.

  The color argument specifies the color which will be used when drawing the
  item specified by itemindex.  The syntax of the color argument depends on
  the type of device being specified.  For 'graphics' and 'ps' devices,
  the color argument is three integers, each between 0 and 255. These
  integers represent the amount of red, green, and blue to be used in that
  color. (The UNIX command showrgb prints these three integers for a lot
  of different colors.) Examples include:
     setcolor('graphics',11,255,0,0)
     setcolor('ps',11,255,255,0)
  For 'hpgl' and 'pcl' devices, the color argument is specified as a
  single word from the following list:
     red green blue cyan magenta yellow white black
  Examples include:
     setcolor('hpgl',11,'red')
     setcolor('pcl',11,'green')

  The 'pen' device is used in conjunction with the 'hpgl' device to assign
  a specific color selection (for example, red) to a physical pen to be
  used by the HPGL plotter.  The itemindex for the 'pen' device is an
  integer between 1 and 8, representing the eight physical pens of the
  plotter.  The color argument is one of the eight colors: red, green,
  blue, cyan, magenta, yellow, white, or black.  As specific examples,
  let us say that the spectrum was assigned to black and the scale was
  assigned to red.  Which physical pen is used is controlled be the 'pen'
  device.  The commands setcolor('pen',3,'black') and setcolor('pen',4,'red')
  would cause the black spectrum to be plotted with pen 3 and the red
  scale to be plotted with pen 4.  Alternatively, the commands
  setcolor('pen',2,'black') and setcolor('pen',2,'red') would cause the
  black spectrum to be plotted with pen 2 and the red scale to also be plotted
  with pen 2.
  
  One special format of the setcolor command identifies the plotters as
  color plotters or monochrome plotters.  This setcolor command has the
  form setcolor('plotter',"black plane","color planes"). The
  'plotter' keyword identifies this special format of setcolor.
  The "black plane" identifies whether the plotter has a separate black
  mode. Currently, all supported plotters have this feature and that
  argument must be specified as the integer 1.  The "color planes"
  specifies how many colors are available.  For color plotters, this
  value is 3, representing the red, green, and blue color planes.  For
  black and white plotters, this value is 0, representing no color planes.
  This format of the setcolor command is only useful for PostScript and
  PCL plotters.  The two cases available are shown below.
     setcolor('plotter',1,0)    selects a black and white plotter.
     setcolor('plotter',1,3)    selects a color plotter.

  The colors command is an interactive program which uses the setcolor
  command to set the colors.  It is not expected the the setcolor command
  would be used directly from the Vnmr command line.  It is a utility
  program used by macros and the colors program.

  The following table lists the available items and the indexes.
