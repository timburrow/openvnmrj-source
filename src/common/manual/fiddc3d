fiddc3d:

fiddc3d is a flag whose default value is 'nnn'.  fiddc3d is created
by the macro `par3d` if the former does not already exist.  The
first character of fiddc3d in the 3-character string refers to the
F3 dimension (sw,np,fn); the second character, to the F1 dimen-
sion (sw1,ni,fn1); and the third character, to the F2 dimension
(sw2,ni2,fn2).  Each character may take one of two values:  'n',
for no time-domain DC correction along the relevant dimension,
and 'y', for time-domain DC correction along the relevant dimen-
sion.

The time-domain DC correction occurs immediately after any LP
(linear prediction) operations and before all other operations
on the time-domain data.



specdc3d:

specdc3d is a flag whose default value is 'nnn'.  specdc3d is created
by the macro `par3d` if the former does not already exist.  The
first character of specdc3d in the 3-character string refers to the 
F3 dimension (sw,np,fn); the second character, to the F1 dimen- 
sion (sw1,ni,fn1); and the third character, to the F2 dimension 
(sw2,ni2,fn2).  Each character may take one of two values:  'n', 
for no spectral DC correction along the relevant dimension, and
'y', for spectral DC correction along the relevant dimension.
 
The spectral DC correction is the last operation to be performed
upon the data prior to forming linear combinations of the data,
using the coefficients in the 3D coefficient file (coef), and then
writing the data to disk.



ptspec3d:

ptspec3d is a flag whose default value is 'nnn'.  ptspec3d is
created by the macro `par3d` if the former does not already exist.
The first character of ptspec3d in the 3-character string refers
to the  F3 dimension (sw,np,fn); the second character, to the F1
dimension (sw1,ni,fn1); and the third character, to the F2 dimen-
sion  (sw2,ni2,fn2).  Each character may take one of two values:  'n',
for no region-selective processing in the relevant dimension, and
'y', for region-selective processing in the relevant dimension.

ptspec3d is functional at this time only for the F3 dimension.  If
ptspec3d is set to 'ynn', only the currently displayed region of
F3 is retained as non-zero values after the F3 transform in the 3D
FT.  A larger F3 region may be kept to insure that the number of
hypercomplex F3 points is a power of 2; but that portion of the F3
spectrum which is retained outside of the currently displayed region
contains only zeroes.  This 3D utility can reduce the fully trans-
formed 3D data size by factors of 2-4, especially in some of the
triple resonance experiment.


ntype3d:

ntype3d is used to indicate whether the F1 or F2 display is expected to
be NTYPE, i.e., opposite to the sense of precession defined by F3, under
normal 3D processing conditions.  If F1 is expected to have an NTYPE
display under normal 3D processing conditions, ntype3d is set to 'yn'.
If F2 is expected to have an NTYPE display under the same conditions,
ntype3d is set to 'ny'.  If both F1 and F2 are expected to have NTYPE
displays, ntype3d is set to 'yy'.  Setting ntype3d to 'yy' changes the
sense of precession in F1 and F2 by negating the imaginary portion of the
t1 and t2 interferograms prior to Fourier transformation.
