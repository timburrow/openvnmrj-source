 import1Dspec - Import ASCII Spectrum into VnmrJ / VNMR  (M)
*******************************************************************************

 Syntax:      import1Dspec('ascii_file'<,'av'>)

 Description: "import1Dspec" imports a 1D ASCII spectrum into VnmrJ / VNMR.
              For the conversion, the ASCII file (Y .. Y or X,Y .. X,Y data,
	      one Y value per line) is read in, and a UNIX utility with the
	      same name ("bin/import1Dspec", a C program) is used to build
	      the binary files "datdir/data" and "datdir/phasefile" in the
	      current experiment. "vs" is set to 100.
	      Note that the imaginary part of the data set consists of zeroes
	      only, i.e., the data cannot be phased - worse than that, setting
	      "lp" to values other than 0 in "ph" mode would cause serious
	      intensity distortions across the spectrum. To prevent such
	      problems, "import1Dspec" offers two options:
	       - by default, the macro sets lp=0 rp=0 and sets the parameter
		 protections bits such that these two parameters cannot be
		 changed. Note that this may cause cause VnmrJ / VNMR to
		 produce errors when the user (intentionally or inadvertently)
		 attempts to change the phase within "ds".
	       - alternatively, you can specify 'av' as second argument. In
		 this case, the macro switches to "av" mode, and "dmg" is
		 locked, such that the user cannot switch to "ph" mode. This
		 has the disadvantage that negative parts of the spectrum are
		 flipped to positive - but at least you will not have the
	    	 usual problem with the line broadening (from the imaginary
		 dispersion tails) that 'av' has with "normal" spectra. The
		 (minor) advantage of this method is that "lp" and "rp" can be
		 used to store the original "rp" and "lp" values.
	      If the current experiment contains nD or arrayed 1D data,
	      "import1Dspec" first does a "setup('H1','CDCl3')", then imports
	      the spectrum,
	      Limitation: only works for simple, non-arrayed 1D spectra. The
	      values of "rp" and "lp" are meaningless, the only meaningful
	      parameter that is set from the imported data set is "fn". The
	      other parameters (notably any applicable acquisition parameter,
	      such as "sw", "tn", "sfrq", "nt", "ct", "np", "at", as well as
	      possibly processing parameters such as weighting etc.) need to
	      be set AFTER THE IMPORTING, along the following scheme:
		$ct=ct   		"remember 'ct'"
		tn=.. sw=.. nt=.. at=.. ...
		setvalue('ct',$ct)	"restore 'ct'"
		lb=.. sb=..
		groupcopy('current','processed','acquisition')
		groupcopy('current','processed','processing')
	      If you have a series of similar 1D ASCII spectra to process
	      (e.g., a series of C13 spectra acquired with the same standard
	      parameters) it is very helpful first to prepare such parameters
	      according to the scheme above, then, for the importing, FIRST
	      to retrieve these parameters, then to call "import1Dspec".

 Arguments:   "ascii_file": path to a pure ASCII file with either Y data (such
	      as from "writetrace") or X,Y data (such as from "writexy").
	      The optional second argument 'av' selects and locks the spectrum
	      in absolute value mode (see above); default is 'ph' mode.

 Examples:    import1Dspec('spectrum.xy')
	      import1Dspec('spectrum.xy','av')
              import1Dspec('spectrum.txt')
              import1Dspec('spectrum.txt','av')
	      import1Dspec('trace.1')
              import1Dspec('trace.1','av')
              import1Dspec('xytrace.1')
              import1Dspec('xytrace.1','av')

 Syntax:      import1Dspec <-fn ##> <-vs #.#> ascii_file <phase_file <data>>

 Description: "import1Dspec" imports a 1D ASCII spectrum into VnmrJ / VNMR.

 Arguments:   "ascii_file": path to a pure ASCII file with either Y data (such
	      as from "writetrace") or X,Y data (such as from "writexy").
	      "source/import1Dspec.c" is a C program that can be compiled with
               		cc -O -o /vnmr/bin/import1Dspec import1Dspec.c -m32
	      or (for a local installation)
               		cc -O -o ~/bin/import1Dspec import1Dspec.c -m32

              "phasefile": Optional path to a binary "phasefile" that can
              afterwards be imported into VNMR / VnmrJ using "import1Dspec";
              the default output file uses the same name as the ASCII file
	      (with extensions ".txt" and ".xy" stripped off) but with ".phf"
              extension.

              "data": Optional path to a binary "data" file that is required
              when importing "phasefile";  the default data file uses the same
              name as the phasefile, but with ".dat" extension.

              "-fn ##": Optional, creates a phasefile with the specified
              number of points (fn/2 in VNMR!!!); should NOT be necessary,
              unless the ASCII file is somehow truncated; by default,
              "import1Dspec" will "zerofill" (add flat baseline at the
              high-field end) if the ASCII file does not contain a power of 2
              in points; the argument following "-fn" MUST be numeric; if the
              specified number is NOT a power of 2, it will be rounded UP to
              the next higher power of 2. If the specified number or its next
              higher power of 2 are smaller than the number of points in the
              ASCII file, the spectrum is truncated at the high-field end.

              "-vs ##": Optional, permits specifying a (down)scaling factor.
              When writing spectra in "ai" (absolute intensity) mode,
              "writetrace" writes out Y values in mm (spectrum multiplied by
              "vs"); specifying "-vs" with the value of "vs" from VNMR permits
              recreating the original ("ai") spectrum. Also here, the argument
              following "-vs" MUST be numeric and positive. The default "vs"
              value (downscaling factor) is 1.0.

 Examples:    import1Dspec spectrum.txt
              import1Dspec spectrum.xy
              import1Dspec spectrum.txt phasefile 
              import1Dspec spectrum.txt phasefile data
              import1Dspec spectrum.xy phasefile data
              import1Dspec -fn 64000 spectrum.xy datdir/phasefile datdir/data
              import1Dspec -vs 327.54 spectrum.xy datdir/phasefile datdir/data
              import1Dspec -vs 327.54 -fn 32000 spectrum.xy
