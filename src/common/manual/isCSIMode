isCSIMode:$n - return 1 if graphics area is split for CSI display, 0 if not
******************************************************************************

In CSI display mode, the graphics area is split to two. Left side is used to display images or/and spectra of CSI or arrayed 1D data in grid layout; right side is used to display and interact with selected trace(s). Spectra in the grid will be updated when selected trace is manipulated. 

Vertical and horizontal are special cases of grid layout.

The graphic area can be split explicitly with command jFunc(88,1) aipSetState(11), and merged by jFunc(88,0) aipSetState(1).
