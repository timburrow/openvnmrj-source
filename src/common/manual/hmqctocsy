##### HMQCTOCSY  with option to null or invert the direct responses #####

	p1 is the 90 degree pulse during the clean-tocsy period.
	p1lvl is the power level for pulse p1.
	window is the off-time for clean-tocsy. p1=25 window=50 (us) typical.

	pw is the 1H 90 during the pulse sequence outside of the mlev period.
	tpwr is the power level for pw.

	mix + trim are the isotropic mixing period, .020 and .002 are typical.

	The parameter mult controls the direct responses:
	*	mult = 0 gives a normal hmqctocsy (direct & relayed inphase).
	*	mult = 1 nulls the direct responses. dm='nnnn' best for this !
	*	mult = 2 inverts the direct responses.
    Remember dps to check things before go !!

NOTE: the hmqctocsy pulse sequence is not supplied with Mercury and GEMINI 2000.
