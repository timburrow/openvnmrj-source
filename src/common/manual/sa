sa	- 	stop acquisition 
*******************************************************************************

  This command is used to stop an experiment that has been submitted to
  acquisition.  If the experiment is active, it is stopped.  Data is retained. 
  The login name, and the fid directory path in 'file' are used as keys to
  find the proper experiment to stop.
  For Unity, UNITYplus and INOVA systems, the experiment can be stopped 
  at several user specified places during acquisition.  These can be,

    1. At the end of the next data accumulation  (ct). E.G. sa or sa('ct')
    2. At a multiple of ct, this is useful when you wish to complete a
         phase cycle before stopping.   E.G. sa(4)
    3. At the end of the next block size.  E.G.  sa('bs')
    4. At the end of the next complete FID.  E.G.  sa('nt')
    5. At the end of the next complete interleave cycle, i.e. the latest
        block size has been complete for all FIDs in the interleave cycle.
        E.G.  sa('il')

  For GEMINI 2000 and Mercury no options are allowed and the experiment is
  stopped at end of the next data accumulation (ct). 

     Format:   sa<('option')> or sa<(##)>
    options:   eos,ct,scan         -   Stop at the next ct
               eob,bs              -   Stop at the next block size
               eof,nt,fid          -   Stop at the next complete fid
               eoc,il              -   Stop at the next complete il cycle
               ## (integer number) -   Stop at the next ct, where the
                                       value of ct is a multiple of  ##
