  mtune - a replacement for qtune
***********************************

"mtune" replaces "qtune" which is obsolete on the 
Varian NMR System and/or Linux. mtune runs in the spectra screen 
and uses VnmrJ panels instead of an external program.

Enter mtune on the command line to retrieve mtune
parameters and panels. 

- all parameters changeable on-the-fly (exception: tune
  channel for the Varian NMR System)

- up to two markers are selectable to tune, for example,
  H1 and 19F at the same time. Use "Set between markers"
  to set the tuning frequency in between the two tuning
  dips, then re-maximize the sweep width.

- vertical autoscale button

- number of acquired points changeable for better resolution
  at large spectral widths (more points will update less often)

- return to your experiment via "quit"

- on quitting mtune, it returns to the original frequencies
