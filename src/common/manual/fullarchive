*******************************************************************************
fullarchive('archivename','sequencename') - SolidsPack macro used to add the 
            zipped tar.Z file for a sequence to a second archive directory. 
*******************************************************************************

The macro fullarchive unzips an zipped, archived sequence sequencename.tar.Z in 
the directory ~/vnmrsys/ARCHIVE/EXP_OUTPUT/ and places the contents in the 
directory ~/vnmrsys/ARCHIVE/archivename. This macro is used to automatically 
unzip an experiment into a package.  

Implement fullarchive after using narchive_SEQUENCE4 to create the zipped. One 
can subsequently zip the directory archivename into archivename.tar.Z.  

For example, the line: 

narchive_SEQUENCE4('babainad2d') fullarchive($name_upper,'babainad2d')

is present in the archive macro fullarchive_ALSOLIDSPACK4 to zip the 
experiment babainad2d.c with its protocol and templates and save it 
in the directory name_upper = 'SOLIDSPACK4'. The archive macro ultimately
zips SOLIDSPACKVJ4 into solidspackvj4.tar.Z and solidspackvj4.README. 
The number "4" in these file names refer to the macro versions that are present 
the version 4 of SolidsPack.
