******************************************************************************
aspRegion('doBC') - If baseline points or mask are defined, this command will
                calculate baseline model based on method selected by bcmode[1] parameter,
                and apply the correction.

                If not defined, it will try to read baseline points from bcfrq and 
                bcamp parameters. If bcfrq does not exists or is empty, baseline points 
                will be generated automatically based on parameter bcmode[2]
                (CWT scaling factor) and bcmode[5] (maximum number of points).

                Once baseline points are defined, baseline model will be calculated
                and baseline correction will be applied.

                if aspRegion('doBC') is called repeatedly, previous correction will be
		undone and new BC will be applied. So recursive BC is not allowed. 
                But corrected spectrum can be saved with savefdfspec(...) command and
                loaded back with asp1D('load',...) command. Then baseline can be modeled 
		and applied again.

                aspRegion('doBC') automatically saves baseline point to bcfrq and 
		bcamp parameters.

		For arrayed data, bseline model is calculated based on current trace
		or first of currently displayed traces.
		If bcmode[8]=0, correction will be applied only to the modeled trace. 
		If bcmode[8]=1, correction will be applied to all traces.

aspRegion('undoBC') - undo baseline correction. If BC is not applied, this command does nothing.
 
aspRegion('CWT') - calculate and display baseline model based on CWT baseline mask 
aspRegion(maxnum) - auto generate baseline points, where maximum is from 2 to 200.
aspRegion('bm') - calculate and display BC model based on baseline points or mask
                according to bcmode[1] parameter.

aspRegion('save'<,path>) - if path not provided, baseline points are saved in bcfrq parameter,
                otherwise they will be saved in curexp+'/datdir/regions'
aspRegion('load'<,path>) - if path not provided, baseline points will be loaded from
                bcfrq and bcamp parameters, otherwise they will be loaded from curexp+'/datdir/regions'
aspRegion('clear') - clear baseline points and the model

aspRegion('show') - display baseline points and the model
aspRegion('hide') - hide baseline points and the model

aspRegion('get',$id,$propertyName):$propertyValue - get display property (lineColor, linethickness)
aspRegion('set',$id,$propertyName,$propertyValue) - set display property

aspRegion:$e,$n - $e=1/0 if baseline model is/is not displayed, $n for number of baseline points.

**********************************************************************************

1. User Interface

aspRegion command is implemented for interactive baseline corrections. 

The command to bring up interactive BC dialog is

bcpopup('init') vnmrjcmd('popup','mode:modeless','file:BCdialog.xml','rebuild:yes','close:aspRegion(
`clear`)','title:Baseline Correction')

where bcpopup('init') creates and initializes bcmode parameter, and calculated baseline model accordingly.

2. Baseline Points 

Baseline points can be generated automatically by specify the maximum number of points.
Points can be modified or deleted in "modify mode". Points can be added in "creation mode". 

aspSetState(1) command set mouse to baseline point modify mode.
In this mode, hover over a baseline point will highlight it. Drag the point with
left mouse button will reposition it. Click the point with right mouse button will delete it.

aspSetState(38) command set mouse to baseline point creation mode.
In this mode, drag over a baseline region will add points to the region. Click will add 
a point at clicked position. Mouse mode automatically returns to modify mode upon release
of the mouse. To override this behavior, hold CTRL key when adding baseline points.

3. Baseline Mask 

Alternatively, baseline can be defined by baseline mask, i.e., 1 if a data point is
on the baseline, 0 if a data point is on a peak.
Baseline mask is automatically calculated by CWT method, which depending on bcmode[2] parameter.

4. Baseline Modeling

Baseline model can be calculated based on baseline points or mask using selected method 
such as spline, polynonial or Whittaker smoother.

5. bcmode Parameter

aspRegion command depends on bcmode parameter in the following fashion:

bcmode[1] - select method for baseline modeling. 
                0 CWT and Whittaker smooth  
                1 spline
                2 polynomial
                3 Whittaker smooth based on user defined baseline points
bcmode[2] - scaling factor for CWT (continues waveform transformation). default 100
bcmode[3] - smooth factor for Whittaker smooth. default 10000.
bcmode[4] - polynomial order (2-20)
bcmode[5] - max # of auto generated baseline points. default is 50
bcmode[6] - scaling factor for auto generating baseline points, default 10
bcmode[7] - smooth factor for modeling baseline using baseline points, default 1.
bcmode[8] - 0 to apply BC to currently modeled trace, 1 to apply BC to all traces.

6. bcfrq and bcamp Parameters

Baseline point frequencies are saved in bcfrq parameter or a file in ppm.
Baseline point amplitudes are saved in bcamp parameter or a file in absolute intensity.
