 noislm - Limit noise in spectrum (M)
*****************************************************************************

      Syntax: noislm<(maximum_noise)>

 Description: "noislm" limits the noise present in a spectrum by reducing the
	      vertical scale (if the noise is smaller than the noise limit,
	      "vs" is left untouched). The default noise limit is 2 mm.
	      The noise limit is in single r.m.s. noise size; the peak-to-peak
	      noise (width of the noise band) will be about twice that value.
	      The noise is determined by taking the smallest value from four
	      5% regions at the left end of the spectrum. Any filter cutoff
	      at the end will decrease the apparent noise in the spectrum, and
	      therefore increase the noise limit in the central part of the
	      spectrum. Because of the particular algorithm used in this macro
	      signals at the left end of the spectrum should not affect the
	      result of "noislm".

   Arguments: "maximum_noise" is the maximum r.m.s. size of the noise (default:
		2 mm)

    Examples: noislm
	      noislm(5)
