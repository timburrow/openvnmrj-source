Help File for this Tool

By default the help file for the current experiment defined by the pslabel parameter
is shown.  For all of the experiments that are found in the experiment selector
items are listed under the Tab names. Thus, for example, there is a help file called
J1CHTab which is general information for all of the supplied experiments located
in that tab. Similarly there is an entry for Homo2DTab with general information for
that group of experiments. For convenience the menu order of this help file arranged
by the Tab names. If one opens Seq.Help the manual-select menu will be positioned so
that all of the similar experiments for that group are nearby. All of help files are
in alphabetical order.

There are two menus.  One to select a specific experiment's help file and the other
to conveniently view a help file describing all experiments in a given tab in the
experiment selector. Both experiment and Tab help is available under the experiment menu.
