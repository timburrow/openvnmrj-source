      Syntax: pshape<(patterfile.ext)>
              dshape<(patterfile.ext)>
	      
 Description: pshape plots the real (X) and imaginary (Y) components of
	      a shaped pulse. Any type of waveform (.RF, .DEC or .GRD) can
	      be plotted.

   Arguments: pshape takes the shape or pattern (file) name as argument.
	      The .ext is shapefile extension indicating the type of the 
              waveform (.RF, .DEC or .GRD). 
	      Absolute and relative filenames can be specified, as well as
	      simple pattern file names (in this case pshape will first look
	      in the local directory, then in the user's shapelib, finally
	      in /vnmr/shapelib. If no filename is given, pshape plots 
	      the last created waveform.
