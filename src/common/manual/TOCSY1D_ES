TOCSY1D_ES - DPFGSE-TOCSY experiment 
                     with Excitation Sculpting solvent suppression

Literature reference:

Parameters:
        sspul       - flag for optional GRD-90-GRD steady-state sequence
        mixT        - TOCSY mixing time
        slpatT      - TOCSY pattern [mlev17, mlev17c, dipsi2, dipsi3]
        slpwrT      - spin-lock power level
        slpwT       - 90 deg pulse width for spinlock
        selshapeA, selpwrA, selpwA, gzlvlA, gtA -
                         shape, power, pulse, level and time for first PFG echo
        selshapeB, selpwrB, selpwB, gzlvlB, gtB -
                         shape, power, pulse, level and time for 2nd PFG echo
        selfrq      - selective frequency (for selective 180)
        gstab       - gradient stalilization delay
        trim        - trim pulse preceeding spinlock
        zqfilt      - optional z-filter after the spin-lock
        tauz1, tauz2, tauz3, tauz4, - delays for the zqfilter
        esshape     - shape file of the 180 deg. selective refocussing pulse
                        on the solvent (may be convoluted for multiple solvents)
        essoftpw    - pulse width for esshape (as given by Pbox)
        essoftpwr   - power level for esshape (as given by Pbox)        
        essoftpwrf  - fine power for esshape by default it is 2048
                        needs optimization for multiple solvent suppression only
                                with fixed esoftpw 
        esgzlvl     - gradient power for the solvent suppression echo
        esgt        - gradient duration for the solvent suppression echo
        alt_grd     - alternate gradient sign(s) in dpfgse on even transients
        lkgate_flg  - lock gating option (on during d1 off during the seq. and at)

The water refocusing shape can be created/updated using the "make_es_shape"
macro. For multiple frequency solvent suppression the esshape file needs to be
created manually.
