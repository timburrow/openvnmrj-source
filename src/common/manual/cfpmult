For 2D experiments such as NOESY, TOCSY, or ROESY, one should run
cfpmult on the transformed first increment, prior to typing wft2da,
to minimize "F2 ridges" in the final 2D spectrum.  This macro cal-
culates an fpmult value for the dataset (which will then be used
by wft2da).

One may do this manually for a 2D dataset by typing

		fpmult=1.0 wft(1) cdc

in the VNMR command line and noting whether the spectrum (essentially
the baseline) moves up or down when "dc" is typed.  One should vary
fpmult until the "dc" correction (jump in the baseline) is as small as
possible.  With care, one can set fpmult to two decimal places.
Typical values for fpmult are 1.00-2.00.  The default value for fpmult
is 1.0.

This only needs to be performed for cosine-type experiments, such as
NOESY, ROESY, or TOCSY where both the t2 FID and the t1 interferogram
decay.  The macro (cfpmult) might give incorrect values for first
increments of experiments having baseline distortions (i.e. water
suppression with 11-echo or 1331); in such cases manual optimization
of fpmult is more suitable.

Why should you bother adjusting fpmult? If the first point in t1 of a
2D spectrum is misadjusted, the result will be the appearance of a
series of "F2 ridges".  These ridges can clearly be seen in the noise
region on the top and bottom of a 2D spectrum (when trace = 'f1') as a
low-intensity profile of the diagonal.  The sign and intensity  of the
ridges is controlled by the magnitude of misset of fpmult. 

It has been recognised that the first point of a FID which is sampled
at exactly t2 = 0  must be multiplied by 0.5 for the Fourier Transform
to function properly.  The first point of a FID influences the overall
integral of the resulting spectrum.  The fpmult parameter gives one a
way to fine-tune the actual correction factor.

NOTE:  When processing 2D data, unless "lp" is approximately 0,
       FPMULT will affect both the DC offset and the curvature of
       the spectrum.  See alfa and calfa.


fpmult1 and fpmult2 operate on "ni" and "ni2" hypercomplex or complex
interferogram data, respectively, in a manner analogous to fpmult.  In
many 2D and 3D experiments, the t1 (ni) and t2 (ni2) values are adjusted
so that there is no first-order phasing in the F1 and F2 dimensions.
In this case, fpmult1 and fpmult2 should be 0.5, the default value.  If
the t1 and t2 values are adjusted so that there is a 180-degree first-
order phase correction, fpmult1 and fpmult2 should be 1.0.
