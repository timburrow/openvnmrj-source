 protune - Run protune experiment (M)
***********************************************************************

Protune is a feature to automatically tune a probe in automation.
To run protune, you must have the protune hardware and software 
installed.  Also, the appropriate protune calibrations must be 
performed on the probe.  

The following parameters are used for protune in automation.

atune (P)   Protune hardware present or not.  Value is 'y' or 'n'.
    Set using System config in System settings under Utilities menu.

wtune (P)   WHEN to tune in automation.  Automatic probe tuning
    will occur when one of the following parameters changes, if
    wtune contains the corresponding character.

          's' - sample number
          'e' - experiment
          'o' - operator
          'v' - solvent
          't' - temperature
          '1' - nucleus (any of tn, dn, dn2, dn3, dn4)
          'n' - do not tune

    To set the wtune parameter, open the Auto Tune Setup dialog 
    with Utilities -> Probe tuning -> Auto tune setup.  Select a
    check box corresponding to when you would like tuning to occur.
    Click the Reset button to set wtune to a default value.

    A default wtune parameter may be set in the probe file with
    the name 'Probewtune'.  


tunemethod (P)  METHOD to use when tuning in automation.  Set the
    tunemethod parameter from the Acquire -> Defaults page.  The
    parameter sets which nuclei to tune, and the tune target levels.
    The parameter specifies a tune method file, which is stored in
    vnmrsys/tune/methods or /vnmr/tune/methods.  Tune method files
    have the following format.

        # this is a comment line.
        tune band1 within X percent of optimum
        tune band2 within Y percent of optimum

    band1 or band2 is highband, lowband, hi2band, lo2band, lo3band,
    lo4band (only the first three characters are needed).  The cutoff
    between highband and lowband is 0.8 * h1freq.  hi2band, lo2band,
    etc. are the nuclei within (tn, dn, dn2, etc.) sorted by frequency
    within the highband or lowband range.  

    band1 or band2 also may be a nucleus parameter name (tn, dn, dn2,
    dn3, dn4), or the value of a particular nucleus (H1, C13, etc.).

    X or Y is a number between 0.1 and 100.0.  It specifies the
    target level to which a nucleus will be tuned, as a percent of
    the optimum pw for ideal tuning and matching.  Typical target
    levels are 5 (coarse), 2 (medium), or 0.5 (fine).

    Comments are allowed in the tune method file with any line that
    starts with a '#'.

    Tune method files may have as few or as many lines as desired.

    A default tunemethod parameter may be set in the probe file 
    with the name 'Probetunemethod'.  


General example: wtune='st1' tunemethod='lohi'
  Tune method file lohi:
      # this is the most common tune method
      tune lowband within 2 percent of optimum
      tune highband within 2 percent of optimum

  When the sample number, temperature, or nucleus (tn, dn, etc.)
  parameter changes during an automation run, first the lowband
  nucleus will be tuned within 2 percent of optimum, then the
  highband nucleus will be tuned within 2 percent of optimum.  Then
  the experiments on the sample will continue.  


Specific example: wtune='st1' tunemethod='lohi'

  Select the Tune prescan check box on the Start -> Study page.
  Submit the following protocols on a sample.

    Proton (tn='H1' dn='C13')
    Carbon (tn='C13' dn='H1')
    Ghsqc  (tn='H1' dn='C13')
    Ghsqc  (tn='H1' dn='N15')

  Before the first Proton, C13 is tuned to 2 percent of optimum,
  then H1 is tuned to 2 percent of optimum.  The Proton, Carbon,
  and C13-Ghsqc experiments are then performed.

  Before the second Ghsqc, N15 is tuned to 2 percent of optimum,
  then H1 is retuned to 2 percent of optimum.  The N15-Ghsqc
  experiment is then performed.  


The following options are available in the protune macro for
probe tuning without automation.

  protune or protune('popup') : If no arguments are given, or if
    the first argument is 'popup', protune opens a dialog for
    tuning a probe to a specific nucleus.  The dialog may also be
    opened from the menu system using Utilities -> Probe Tuning
    -> Tune probe.

    In the upper panel of the dialog, click on a nucleus button
    (e.g. H1) to tune the probe to a nucleus using a coarse
    target level (5 percent of optimum).  In the lower panel of
    the dialog, if present, enter a nucleus (e.g.  H1), select a
    tune criterion from the menu (e.g. Medium), and then click
    the Tune to Criterion button to tune the probe.

  protune('calibrate') : Run probe tuning using protune cali-
    bration graphical user interface.  This option is used mostly
    during installation.

  protune('nucleus', $nucleus <, $target > ) : Run probe tuning
    on a nucleus specified by $nucleus (e.g. 'H1', 'C13').  If
    $target is specified, it sets the target level for tuning
    as a percentage of optimum pw.  If $target is not specified,
    a default target of 5 percent is used.

  Other protune arguments are used to run protune in automation,
  and are not usually used from the command line.  When protune
  is run from automation, the manual protune graphical user
  interface is not displayed during tune operations.
