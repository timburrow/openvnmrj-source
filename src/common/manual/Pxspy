 Pxspy - create shape definition using Fourier coefficients (UNIX)
********************************************************************************

      Syntax: Pxspy shape/pattern_file

 Description: Pxspy converts shaped pulse (*.RF, *.DEC and *.GRD) into a
	      Fourier series and produces an output file "pbox.cf" in the
	      user's shapelib (~/vnmrsys/shapelib) which can be used to
              create a wave definition file in wavelib directory.
	      This program can also be used to convert hard pulse decoupling
	      sequences into soft ("cool") decoupling waveforms, see E.Kupce,
	      J.Boyd & I.Campbell, JMR 110A (1994) 109.
	      The resulting Fourier coefficients may slightly depend on the
	      number of points in the waveform.
	      Pxspy is an interactive program. The user will be asked to enter
	      the shape/pattern name - a code for the Pbox program, typically
	      a few characters, like "e2" for E-BURP-2, etc.; optionally the
	      name can be followed by some comment, e.g.:
		xyz : refocusing pulse, universal rotor.
	      Next, the user will be asked to enter the on-resonance flip angle
	      in degrees. The default flip angle is 90 degrees. As problems
	      would arise if the on-resonance flip angle is zero (the Fourier
	      coefficients would all be scaled down to 0.0, if the amplitude
	      of the zero-frequency component is equal to zero), entering zero
	      selects the default of 90 degrees.
	      The user then is requested to enter the product of bandwidth and
	      pulse length - this number is used to calculate the pulse length
	      for a given excitation bandwidth. Enter 0 if this is unknown.
	      Last, the number of Fourier coefficients must be entered; the
	      default is 10 (the default is selected also if 0 is entered).
	      The output of Pxspy is stored in ~/vnmrsys/shapelib/pbox.cf.
	      Pxspy can be (re-)compiled with
		cc -O -o Pxspy Pxspy.c -lm

   Arguments: Pxspy expects the name of a shape or pattern file (*.RF, *.DEC,
	      or *.GRD) as argument. The name must include the extension and
	      can be given as relative or absolute pathname, as well as the
	      basename only (with extension). In the latter case the file is
	      first looked up in the user's shapelib (~/vnmrsys/shapelib),
	      then (if not found) in the system shapelib (/vnmr/shapelib).

    Examples: Pxspy myshape.RF
	      Pxspy /vnmr/shapelib/myshape.RF
	      Pxspy ~/vnmrsys/shapelib/myshape.RF
	      Pxspy myshape.DEC
	      Pxspy myshape.GRD
