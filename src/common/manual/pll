pll	  Plot a line list

Format:	  pll<(x,y,min y)>
          where x=x position of upper left of line list
                y=y position of upper left of line list
                min y=minimum y at which to reset back to top

	  pll produces on a plotter a columnar line list, similar to what
	  would appear on a printer.  This is quite different from the
	  alternative method of plotting peak frequencies, using the ppf
	  command.  The output is automatically formated into multiple
	  columns depending on the number of lines.

Examples: pll
	  pll(20,150)
	  pll(5,wc2max*.8,wc2max*.5)
