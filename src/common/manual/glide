glide	Interactive window based data acquisition and data processing 
******************************************************************************

The GLIDE window provides a mouse-driven method for data acquisition and 
data processing.

Starting GLIDE

To start GLIDE and open the GLIDE window, click on the GLIDE button in the 
Permanent menu. After GLIDE starts, this button functions as a toggle 
between hiding the GLIDE window and bringing the GLIDE window to the 
foreground. GLIDE can also be started by entering "glide" in the VNMR input 
window.

Exiting GLIDE

To exit GLIDE and close the GLIDE window, click on the Exit button in the 
GLIDE window. GLIDE can also be exited by entering "glide('exit')" in the VNMR 
input window.

Main GLIDE Window

The Main GLIDE window contains the Glide icon (which is nonfunctional) and six 
buttons: Setup, Custom, Go, Recall, Exit and Help. The buttons are defined 
in file glide_defaults that resides in the directory vnmrsystem/glide/
templates or in vnmruser/glide/templates.

Setup Button

Clicking on the Setup button opens a window with menus for experiment 
selection and solvent selection. If the optional spinner hardware is 
installed, this window contains Eject and Insert buttons, and if the Sample 
Management System is installed, the window contains a place to enter the
sample location.

Also in the window is a box to type in a file name to be used for storing data 
when archiving is enabled, and another box to type the text to be plotted with 
the spectra if a plot is requested.

Custom Button

Clicking on the Custom button opens a window with four buttons: Acquire, 
Process, Plot, and Store. 

Each button deals with a particular phase of an experiment. The Acquire button 
brings up a window for adjusting acquisition parameters, the Process and 
Plot buttons bring up windows for adjusting processing and plotting 
parameters, and the Store button brings up a window for storing data in a 
directory assigned by the VNMR administrator. The Store button is only 
available if the VNMR administrator has enabled archiving by your group.

Most of these windows have three buttons at the bottom: Do, Reset, and 
Close. The Do button executes the function of the window: in the Acquire 
window, Do starts an acquisition; and in the Plot window, Do generates a plot. 
The Reset button resets all parameters to their default values. The Close 
button closes the window while retaining the values selected for parameters.

In the Custom window, next to the Acquire, Process, Plot and Store buttons, 
are toggle buttons. Each toggle button switches its phase from Selected to 
Not Selected, and back. When Selected, this phase of the experiment is 
executed when the Go button in the Main GLIDE window is clicked. This 
enables data acquisition to be started by clicking the Go button or, after 
data is acquired, to process and plot the data also by clicking Go.

In each of these windows, when the mouse pointer is over a particular 
parameter, a help message is displayed at the bottom of the window. 

When using GLIDE, no customizing is ever needed. All parameters have a 
default value so that when the Go button is clicked, the selected 
experiment is acquired, processed, plotted, and archived.

Go Button

Clicking on the Go button executes all tasks selected in the Custom window.

Recall Button

Clicking on the Recall button opens a window to retrieve a data file. If the 
current experiment has subexperiments, as is the case after a multiple 
experiment such as H-C-APT is completed, a menu button is available showing 
the different subexperiments. Type in a full data path, starting with a '/', 
or select an item from the subexperiment menu and click on Retrieve to retrieve 
the data. Click on Close if you do not want to retrieve any data.

Exit Button

Clicking on the Exit button removes the main GLIDE window and all of its 
subwindows, and exits the GLIDE program.

Help Button

Clicking on the Help button displays these instructions.

Exploring with GLIDE

Not every aspect of an experiment can be set through GLIDE, but GLIDE provides 
guidance and the opportunity for exploration, while always supplying a 
secure path back through the "default" buttons in each phase. If GLIDE does 
not provide enough adjustments, further exploration is possible through the 
VNMR menu buttons, just below the GLIDE window. If this still is not 
enough, the GLIDE window can be hidden and any VNMR command can be entered 
in the VNMR input window.

For Further Information

The manual Getting Started contains more information about using GLIDE. For 
information on setting up experiments for GLIDE and how to adjust GLIDE 
icons, text, buttons, and colors, see the manual VNMR User Programming.
