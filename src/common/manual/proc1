*************************************************

proc and proc1 specify the type of data processing to be
performed upon the t2 FID and the t1 interferogram, re-
spectively.  Two types of data processing are currently
supported:


		 ft   -   complex Fourier transform
		rft   -   real Fourier transform


All Varian data must be processed along t2 with a complex
FT.  Sequentially sampled Bruker data (the usual case) must
be processed along t2 with a real FT; simultaneously sampled
Bruker data, with a complex FT.

All pure absorptive 2D data collected by the States-Haberkorn
(Hypercomplex) method must be processed along t1 with a complex
FT.  Similar data collected by the TPPI method on a Varian
spectrometer can be processed in one of two ways, depending
upon how the data was collected:


	    phase = 3:       complex FT  (standard way)
	    phase = 1,4:     real FT     (new way)


Pure absorptive 2D data collected by the TPPI method on a
Bruker spectrometer must be processed along t1 with a real
FT, i.e., proc1 = 'rft'.

Setting proc or proc1 to 'lp' performs linear prediction
processing.  See man('lp') for details.

Setting proc1 to 'ht' performs Hadamard processing.
See man('ht') for details.

If the parameter proc (or proc1) does not exist, it can be
created with the following commands in Vnmr:

		create('proc','flag')
		setgroup('proc','processing')
		setlimit('proc',10,0,0)
