readbrutape filename [num]

	This is a shell script for reading bruker data files from a
	9-track tape.  The script reads one file from the Bruker tape
	into the UNIX file 'filename.bru'.

	num (optional) is the number of files skipped and INCLUDES the
	header file.  If num is not specified, the script reads the
	first file.  If num = 0, there is no rewinding, and the first
	file (or the next file) on the tape is read.               

	Bruker tapes are likely to be made at 1600 bpi, although 1600
	bpi is not a requirement.  It is assumed that Bruker tapes are
	made with a header file which is the first file on the tape.
	The header file is ignored.
