******************************************************************************
aipMakeMaps<('li'/'ll'<,mapName<,specKey>>)> - make csi map.
******************************************************************************

If first argument is not given, 'li' is used.

Arguments:

'li' - make map of peak integrals. Peak is selected by cursor (cr). Integral region is defined by lifrq parameter.

'll' - make map of peak height. Peak is selected by cursor (cr).

mapName - is a full path including file name, but not suffix .fdf. Default is xxx.csi/maps/li_<chem_shift_ppm>.

specKey - is the key of spectral data. If not specified, 'spec' is assumed. If 'spec' data is not loaded, phasefile buffer 'SPEC' is used.

The major difference between aipMakeMaps and liMMap or llMMap is that aipMakeMaps can make maps for ROIs. If ROI of types box, oval, polygon or polyline exists (graphically displayed), aipMakeMaps will make CSI map for the ROI(s). The FOV and position of a csi map for a ROI will be calculated properly.

This command exclusively uses cr and lifrq parameters to determine peak position and integral region. Whereas liMMap and llMMap allow user to pass frequencies as arguments explicitly. 

This command allows selecting spectral data explicitly if one or more fdf spectral data are loaded.
