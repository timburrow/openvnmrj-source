      Syntax: dshape<(patterfile.ext)>
	      pshape<(patterfile.ext)>

 Description: dshape displays the real (X) and imaginary (Y) components of
	      a shaped pulse. Any type of waveform (.RF, .DEC or .GRD) can
	      be displayed.

   Arguments: dshape takes the shape or pattern (file) name as argument.
              The .ext is shapefile extension indicating the type of the 
              waveform (.RF, .DEC or .GRD). 
	      Absolute and relative filenames can be specified, as well as
	      simple pattern file names (in this case dshape will first look
	      in the local directory, then in the user's shapelib, finally
	      in /vnmr/shapelib. If no filename is given, dshape displays 
	      the last created waveform.
