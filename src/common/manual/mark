mark -  determine the intensity of the spectrum at a point
        determine the integral over a region
*******************************************************************

One can perform either 1D or 2D MARK operations in CURSOR or BOX
mode for a total of four separate functions.  In CURSOR mode, the
intensity at a particular point is found.  In BOX mode, the integral
over a region is calculated.  For 2D operations, this is a volume
integral.  In addition, BOX mode finds the maximum intensity and the
coordinate(s) of the maximum intensity.

For 2D operations in BOX mode, 4 input values are required.  For 1D
operations in CURSOR mode, only one value is needed.  The other two
functions require two values.  If no values are entered, the command
uses the values of parameters `cr' and `delta' (1D operations) or
`cr1', `delta1', `cr' and `delta' (2D operations).

In BOX mode, the first parameter is the position of the left edge of
the region to be integrated.  The second is the width of the region,
which extends to the right.  Each value must be entered in Hertz.

For 2D operations in CURSOR mode, the first numeric parameter defines
the position along the F1 axis.  The second parameter defines the
position along the F2 axis.  For 2D operations in BOX mode, the
first pair of parameters defines the region along the F1 axis; the
second pair defines the region along the F2 axis.

This command requires that transformed data be present in the current
experiment.  If required, it will recompute the phase file from the
complex data; in other words, it will rephase the data if required.
However, the MARK command requires parameters from the command line if
no data is displayed, i. e. if DS or DCONI has not been executed.

Note that 2D operations require that 2D data be present.  This not
only means that `ni' must be larger than 1, but also that the data
was transformed using FT1D, FT2D or an equivalent (and not FT or its
equivalents).

The MARK command and the MARK button of DS write output to a
file in the current experiment.  For 1D operations, the file is named
"mark1d.out"; for 2D operations it is "mark2d.out".  If this file already
exists, the VNMR program appends output from the current MARK operation to
the end of the file.  (Previous versions of VNMR used "ds.out" and
"dconi.out" as files for output from the MARK button).  Either file
may be read by other programs at any time between operations.

The MARK command returns values if requested.  For either 1D or 2D
operations, the first will be the intensity (maximum if BOX mode was
selected) and the second will be the integral.  In 2D mode, the third
and fourth will be the coordinates where the maximum intensity was
was found.  Only one value, the intensity, is returned in CURSOR mode
for either 1D or 2D operations, since other values have no meaning in
CURSOR mode.

The following criteria establish the exact function.  The command
checks them in the order below until it determines the exact function.

    1.  Number of numeric parameters
    2.  Number of return values called out
    3.  Which display command (DS or DCONI) was last used
    4.  Nature of the data in the experiment

The first two only serve to distinguish between BOX mode and CURSOR mode.
The nature of the data in the experiment and the last display command
which was entered determines whether a 1D or a 2D operation is selected.

Use the `trace' keyword to select a 1D operation if 2D data is present.
It must be either the first or the last parameter to the command.  The
current experiment must contain 2D data for the `trace' keyword to be
used.  Example:

    mark('trace',400)	   "intensity at 400 Hz in the current trace"


The `reset' keyword erases the output files from the MARK command.  No
other parameter or argument can be used with this keyword.  Use the VNMR
command MV to rename the current MARK output files:

    mv(curexp+'/mark1d.out',curexp+'/mark.16.01.89')

Examples:

   1D data sets:

     mark(cr)                   "CURSOR mode for 1D data"
     mark(cr,delta)             "BOX mode for 1D data"

   2D data sets (2D mode):      Note:  in this mode,  the order of the
                                arguments to mark is independent of the
                                trace parameter.

     mark(cr1,cr)               "CURSOR mode for 2D data"
     mark(cr1,delta1,cr,delta)  "BOX mode for 2D data"

   2D data sets (1D mode):      Note:  in this mode,  the selection of the
                                arguments to mark is dependent on the
                                trace parameter.  If trace='f2',  then cr,
                                delta, sp, or wp would be appropriate.
                                If trace='f1', then cr1, delta1, sp1,
                                and / or wp1 would be appropriate.

     mark('trace',cr)           "CURSOR mode for selected 2D trace"
     mark('trace',cr1,delta1)   "BOX mode for selected 2D trace"
