usemark	  Use "Mark" file for deconvolution

Format:	  usemark

	  Use the file "ds.out", which was created by using the "mark"
	  option while interactively displaying a spectrum, as the
	  starting point for a deconvolution.  If the mark was done
	  using a single cursor, the information contained is used
	  to initialize the frequencies and intensities only, with
	  the parameter "slw" (simulation line width) set to the
	  measured width of the tallest line in the displayed
	  spectrum.  If the mark was done using two cursors, then
	  the average frequency of the two cursors is taken as the
	  peak frequency, and the difference is taken as the line
	  width, thus allowing different starting line widths for
	  different lines in the spectrum.
