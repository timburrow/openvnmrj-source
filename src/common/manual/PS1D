PS1D: Double spin-echo type experiment to acquire an effectively
      homonuclear-decoupled proton spectrum.

USAGE

The PureShift 1D experiment is useful to simplify complicated proton
spectra dominated by overlapping multiplets. The result is a
“proton- decoupled” spectrum of singlets at the true chemical shift of each
proton multiplet. The sensitivity is much less than the standard proton
experiment. All parameters are set from the “Acquire” tab/”Defaults” panel
unless otherwise specified.
