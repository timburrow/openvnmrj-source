 p31p - Processing of 1D phosphorus spectra (M)
*****************************************************************************

      Syntax: p13p

 Description: "p13p" is a macro for processing non-arrayed 1D phosphorus spectra
              using a set of standard macros. p31p is called by the proc1d
	      macro, but can also be used "by hand".
	      Fully automatic processing (up to a point where a spectrum could
	      be plotted) is provided:
	      Fourier transformation (using pre-set weighting functions), auto-
	      matic phasing (aphx macro), automatic integration (integrate
	      macro, if required only), vertical scale adjustment (vsadjc
	      macro), avoiding excessive noise (noislm macro), threshold
	      adjustment (thadj macro), and referencing to the TMS signal,
              if present (tmsref macro).
