readfile(path, 'par1', 'par2', <,cmpstr <,tree> >):num

readfile reads the contents of a file and puts the contents into two
supplied parameters.  The first word on each line in the file is placed in the
first parameter.  The remainder of the line is placed in the second parameter.
An optional fourth argument specifies a string which is used to match the
first word of the line.  For example, if the file contained
H1pw   10
H1pwr  55
C13pw  14
C13pwr 50
and the comparison string was set to H1, only the lines starting with H1
would be put into the parameters.  Namely, H1pw and H1pwr.

Arguments:
 path is the path name of the file to read.
 par1 is the name of the parameter to hold the first word of the line.
 par2 is the name of the parameter to hold the remainder of each line.
 cmpstr is the optional comparison string for matching the first word.
 tree is an optional parameter to select the tree for par1 and par2.
    The possibilities are current, global, and local.  Current is the
    default.  Local is used if the parameters are $ macro parameters.
    If tree is used, the cmpstr must also be supplied.  If cmpstr is
    '', then it is ignored.

The par1 and par2 parameters must already exist. If par1 or par2 are
defined as a real parameter, as opposed to a string parameter, then
if the value does not have a number as the first word, a zero will be
assigned.

num will be set to the number of items in the arrayed params par1 and par2.

Lines which only contain whitspace are not added to the parameters.
Lines which start with a # are not added to the parameters.  Lines
which start with a # can be used as comment lines.
If a line only contains a single word, that word is put into the
first parameter.  The corresponding array element of the second
parameter will be set to an empty string.

The readfile will return the number of lines added to the parameters.

Examples using a prototype file containing the following.

           # A readfile test case

           # Proton values
           H1pw   10
           H1pwr  55

           # Carbon values
           C13pw  14
           C13pwr 50

           H1macro  ft f full aph vsadj
           End

readfile(systemdir+'/probes/testcase','attr','vals')

This sets the attr and vals parameters to arrays of six strings.
attr='H1pw','H1pwr','C13pw','C13pwr','H1macro','End'
vals='10','55','14','50','ft f full aph vsadj',''

readfile(systemdir+'/probes/testcase','$attr','$vals','H1','local')

This sets the temporary $attr and $vals parameters to arrays of three strings.
$attr='H1pw','H1pwr','H1macro'
$vals='10','55','ft f full aph vsadj'

The readfile command might be used in conjunction with the teststr
command.  The teststr command can be used to search an arrayed
parameter to determine the index of a specified element.
For example,
teststr(attr,'H1pwr'):$e

vals[$e] will be the value of 'H1Pwr'
