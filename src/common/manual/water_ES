water_ES -   experiment with solvent suppression by excitation sculpting.  
Literature reference: 
	T.L. Hwang and A.J. Shaka; JMR A112, 275-279 (1995)
	C. Dalvit; J. Biol. NMR, 11, 437-444 (1998)

Parameters:
	sspul	    - flag for optional GRD-90-GRD steady-state sequence
	flipback    - flag for an optional selective 90 flipback pulse
				on the solvent to keep it along z all time
	flipshape   - shape of the selective pulse for flipback='y'
	flippw	    - pulse width of the selective pulse for flipback='y'
	flippwr	    - power level of the selective pulse for flipback='y'
        flippwrf    - fine power for flipshape by default it is 2048
                        may need optimization with fixed flippw and flippwr
	phincr1	    - small angle phase shift between the hard and the
		            selective pulse for flipback='y' (1 deg. steps)
                            to be optimized for best result
	esshape     - shape file of the 180 deg. selective refocussing pulse
			on the solvent (may be convoluted for multiple solvents)
	essoftpw    - pulse width for esshape (as given by Pbox)
	essoftpwr   - power level for esshape (as given by Pbox)	
        essoftpwrf  - fine power for esshape by default it is 2048
		        needs optimization for multiple solvent suppression only
				with fixed essoftpw
	esgzlvl	    - gradient power for the solvent suppression echo
        alt_grd     - alternate gradient sign(s) in dpfgse on even transients
	prg_flg     - flag for an optional purge pulse at the end of the sequence
				set prg_flg='y' tu suppress protein background
	prgtime	    - pulse width of the purge pulse for prg_flg='y' (in seconds!!)	
        prgpwr	    - power level for the purge pulse for prg_flg='y'
        lkgate_flg  - lock gating option (on during d1 off during the seq. and at)

The water refocusing shape and the water flipback shape can be created/updated
using the "make_es_shape" and "make_es_flipshape" macros, respectively. For
multiple frequency solvent suppression the esshape file needs to be created
manually.
