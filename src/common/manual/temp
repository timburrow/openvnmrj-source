temp -  start up the interactive temperature control process 
***********************************************************

   The temperature control process (temp) allows interactive
   setting of the sample temperature.  The temperature control
   may also be turned off. When the temperature cable is
   reconnected to a probe, the temperature controller needs to
   be reset.  The temperature process can reset the controller
   for this purpose.

   Access control for the temperature is also provided.  One may choose
   to allow the temperature to be controlled from within an experiment,
   using the parameter temp and the commands su, go, ga, or au.
   This is the default behavior.  Alternatively, the temperature
   control process allows one to turn off experiment control of the
   temperature.  In this mode, only the temperature control process
   (and acqi and sethw) may set the temperature.  This has the
   advantage that, often times, the temp parameter is different in
   different experiments.  Joining a different experiment and typing
   go may unexpectedly change the temperature.  This mode prevents
   this.

   If the temperature is controlled only via the temperature control
   process, then the action to be taken after a temperature failure
   may be selected.  Either a warning is given and the acquisition
   continues, or an error is given and acquisition is stopped.  Note that
   if experiment control of temperature is selected, this selection
   of the action to be taken after a temperature failure is provided
   by the parameter tin.  Note that in the temperature control process,
   if experiment control of temperature speed is selected, then the
   choices for failure handling are faded, since they are inoperative.
