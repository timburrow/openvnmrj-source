           *********************************************************

Parameters:	pp	Proton pulse width (usec)
                pplvl   Power for proton decoupler pulse  (with linear amp)
		d2	Should equal 1/(2*JCH) (sec)
		pw	90 degree pulse on C13 (usec)
		p1	180 degree pulse on C13 (usec)
		dm	Must be 'nny' or 'yny'
		dmm	Must be 'wcw' (or 'fcf'), respectively

Technique:	Array PP, starting at 0, and making sure that D1 is reasonably
	 	long compared to the C13 relaxation times.  Phase the first
	 	spectrum (PP=0). CH and CH3 carbons should go from positive to
	 	negative, CH2 from positive to zero and again positive; all
	  	peaks will null when PP is a 90 degree pulse.  The CH carbons
	 	will be the most sensitive.


		If the decoupler channel uses a linear amplifier, PPLVL is
		the power level for the proton decoupler pulse and DPWR, the
		power level for broadband proton decoupling.  If the decoup-
		ler channel uses a class C amplifier, maximum power is used
		for the proton decoupler pulse and DHP specifies the power
		level for broadband proton decoupling.
