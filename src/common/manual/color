******************************************************************************
color allows selection of plotting colors through a Graphical User Interface .
******************************************************************************

When the "color" macro is invoked, a window with color paletes appears
on the screen and users then can select appropriate colors for plotting 
the Spectrum, Integral, Scale, etc.  At the top of the window, you
can select whether you have a color plotter or a black and white plotter.
If you have a color printer, all of the top group of color assignments
should be made.

Additionally, if the users have a Pen Plotter, they must route the
selected colors to the designated pens.  This is done in the Pen Plotter
section of the window. For example, red can be assigned to pen #3, green can be
assigned to pen #5, regardless of the actual color of the pens in the plotter.
As another example, if you only have a single pen in the plotter, all the
colors can be assigned to that pen number.
By clicking the "Apply" button, this color information will be the default,
and will last until new selections are entered.
After all the plotting colors have been recorded, the users now can dismiss the
color window and use the normal plotting commands from the vnmr command line.
