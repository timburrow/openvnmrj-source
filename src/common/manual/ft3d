ft3d is a macro which executes the program ft3d in the VNMR system
`bin` directory ($vnmrsystem/bin).  The environmental parameter PATH
specifies the list of directories through which UNIX searches until
it finds an executable ft3d program.  The first string argument which
is a non-keyword is 'datadir'.  'datadir' (without the /data sub-
directory appended) is an optional argument which specifies the output
directory for the 3D spectral data file(s).  The default directory for
the 3D spectral data is curexp/datadir3D.  nfiles (an integer) is an
optional argument which specifies the number of 3D data files (data1
to data`nfiles`) used to store the transformed 3D data.  nfiles must
be <= 32.  If nfiles is entered, distributed F1F2 processing will be
performed by the ft3d program if possible.

If the optional keyword 'nocoef' is submitted as an argument to the
ft3d macro, VNMR will not create a 3D coefficient file prior to invoking
the ft3d program.  This is useful if one has modified an existing 3D
coefficient file and does not want it to be overwritten prior to the
3D transform.  By default, ft3d calls the make3dcoef macro to create
a coefficient file using f1coef and f2coef string parameter values.

The 't1t2' and 't2t1' are optional arguments to explicitly
define the order of t1 and t2 arrays (other than ni and ni2).
By default the macro looks at array parameter to make a
decision and in that case if any parameter other than phase
and phase2 are arrayed the macro aborts.

The next set of optional keywords for ft3d pertain to plane extraction
following the complete 3D FT.  'xall' indicates that all three 2D plane
types, F1F3, F2F3, and F1F2, are to be automatically extracted at the
end of the 3D FT.  The output directory for the extracted 2D planes is
the same as that for the 3D spectral data except that the former uses
the /extr subdirectory whereas the latter uses the /data subdirectory.
'f1f3', 'f2f3', and 'f1f2' can be used to select any combination of
plane types to be extracted.  The ft3d macro allows the user to submit
any of these keywords more than once.  The program getplane, however,
will display an error and abort if any one plane type is multiply de-
fined for extraction.

The 3D FID data must be loaded into the experiment in which the ft3d
macro is to be run.  The ft3d program is started up in background mode
by this macro so that VNMR remains free for interactive processing.
In other words, one can start a 3D transform from within exp4 and, at
the same time, continue with any 1D or 2D processing of the 3D FID
data within the same experiment using VNMR.  If the 'fg' argument is
given to ft3d, then the processing is done if foreground.  No additional
processing will be possible until the ft3d program has finished.

The optional 'noft' argument is similar to the 'noft' arguments to ft2d
and ft. The Fourier transform step will be skipped in all three dimensions.
In contradistinction to the 1D and 2D analogs, the 'noft' argument to
ft3d causes all processing to be skipped; no weighting, phasing, etc.
are performed.  All axes will be treated as frequency axes.

Within the /data 3D data subdirectory, there are the following files
and further subdirectories:


	1. data1 through data#:

	   These are the actual binary 3D spectral data files.
	   The number of data files depends upon the size of
	   the largest 2D plane and the value for the UNIX
	   environmental parameter `memsize` if nfiles is not
	   entered.


	2. info:

	   This is a directory which stores the 3D coefficient
	   text file (coef), the binary information file (procdat),
	   the 3D parameter set (procpar3d), and the automation
	   file (auto).  The first three files are created by
	   the set3dproc() command within VNMR.  The last file
	   is created by the ft3d program.


	3. log:

	   This is a directory which stores the log files produced
	   by the ft3d program.  f3 contains all log output for
	   the F3 transform.  For the F2 and F1 transforms, there
	   are two log file for each data file, one for the F2
	   transform (f2.#) and one for the F1 (f1.#).  The master
	   one for the F2 transform and one for the F1.  The
	   file contains all the log output produced by the master
	   ft3d program.


The order of the arguments to the ft3d macro is not important.
