Certain VnmrJ operations have software hooks to allow for easy user
customization.  For example, the svf operation will call a macro
named usersvf, if it exists. That usersvf macro could copy additional
files into the .fid directory, write a log file, or email a message.
It is up to the user to decide how they may want to customize the
operation.

The mechanism we use to provide this customization is dousermacro.
This macro is often called with the syntax dousermacro($0) where
$0 is the name of the macro being executed (svf in the example above.)
The dousermacro prepends the string 'user' to the first passed
argument and then checks if that macro exists. If it does, it is
executed. If any additional arguments are passed to dousermacro,
these are passed along to the 'user'+rootName macro.

Some of the operations that have these dousermacro hooks include:

bootup
calibrate
operatorlogin
operatorlogout
plot
process
rt
rtp
savefid
svf
updateprobe

Creating a local macro named, for example, userplot will allow
customization any time the plot macro is called.  There are several
other macros that call dousermacro. They generally require a fairly
good understanding of how these other macros are used in order to
effectively use the dousermacro tool. You can find all the macros
that call dousermacro by executing:  grep dousermacro /vnmr/maclib/*
from a shell tool.
