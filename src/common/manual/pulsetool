*****************************************************************
  Pulsetool is an interactive pulse shape analysis tool.  This program is a
standalone application which allows analysis of RF pulse shapes through 
graphical displays of various representations of the pulse.  An extensive
on-line help facility guides users through the various applications.  A
useful starting point is to examine some of the .RF files in /vnmr/shapelib.
