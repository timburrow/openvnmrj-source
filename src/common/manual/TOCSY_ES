	Features included:
		States-TPPI in F1
		z-filter pulse with flipback option
		
Parameters:
        sspul       - flag for optional GRD-90-GRD steady-state sequence
        mixT        - TOCSY mixing time
        slpatT      - TOCSY pattern [mlev17, mlev17c, dipsi2, dipsi3]
        slpwrT      - spin-lock power level
        slpwT       - 90 deg pulse width for spinlock
        trim        - trim pulse preceeding spinlock
        zfilt       - selects z-filter with flipback option
                           [Requires gradient and PFGflg=y]
        flipback    - flag for an optional selective 90 flipback pulse
                                on the solvent to keep it along z all time
        flipshape   - shape of the selective pulse for flipback='y'
        flippw      - pulse width of the selective pulse for flipback='y'
        flippwr     - power level of the selective pulse for flipback='y'
        flippwrf    - fine power for flipshape by default it is 2048
                        may need optimization with fixed flippw and flippwr
        phincr1     - small angle phase shift between the hard and the
                            selective pulse for flipback='y' (1 deg. steps)
                            to be optimized for best result
        esshape     - shape file of the 180 deg. selective refocussing pulse
                        on the solvent (may be convoluted for multiple solvents)
        essoftpw    - pulse width for esshape (as given by Pbox)
        essoftpwr   - power level for esshape (as given by Pbox)        
        essoftpwrf  - fine power for esshape by default it is 2048
                        needs optimization for multiple solvent suppression only
                                with fixed esoftpw 
        esgzlvl     - gradient power for the solvent suppression echo
        esgt        - gradient duration for the solvent suppression echo
        alt_grd     - alternate gradient sign(s) in dpfgse on even transients
        lkgate_flg  - lock gating option (on during d1 off during the seq. and at)

The water refocusing shape and the water flipback shape can be created/updated
using the "make_es_shape" and "make_es_flipshape" macros, respectively. For
multiple frequency solvent suppression the esshape file needs to be created
manually.
