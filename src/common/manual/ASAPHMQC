ASAPHMQC: Gradient selected phase-sensitive gHMQC as a fast method

See the J1CHTab and HMQC entries for general information.

ASAPHMQC takes advantage of the pool of 1H magnitization on 12C by pumping it in effect
back onto the desired 1H's attached to 13C. This allows a very fast experiment recycle
time. Note that if the default is turned off for asap a generic gHMQC with adiabatic
13C 180s is done. Be sure to increase the value of the d1 delay if this is done.
