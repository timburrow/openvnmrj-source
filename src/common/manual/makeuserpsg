MAKEUSERPSG is a UNIX makefile which is invoked by the shellscript
PSGGEN.  MAKEUSERPSG has the following attributes:


	1.   	All compilation and library construction is
		performed in the user PSG directory;

	2.	Any additional source (*.c) and header files
		(*.h and *.p) and the makefile itself, unless
		already present,  are linked from the system
		PSG directory into the user PSG directory via
		soft links;

	3.	The three possible names for the user PSG object
		library are LIBPSGLIB.A, LIBPSGLIB_FPC.A, and
		LIBPSGLIB_FPA.A.  The first name is used only
		for Sun 4 systems.  The last two names are used
		for Sun 3 systems with SEQGEN_OPTION set to
		f68881 or ffpa, respectively.


MAKEUSERPSG currently has no error recovery.  Therefore, if an error
occurs, the user PSG directory will not be cleaned up, i.e., the
soft links to files in the system PSG directory will remain in this
directory along with any object file previously created by the make-
file.
