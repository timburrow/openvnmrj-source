An application directory is a directory where VnmrJ can look for templates,
maclib, manual, menujlib, parlib, probes, psg, psglib, seqlib, shims, tablib,
shapelib, gshimlib, and mollib directories.  It will not look for expN
directories, global, or other files or directories.  The exists
command has been enhanced to search for other files and directories in
the applications directories, allowing users flexibility to customize
their applications. The appdirs macro starts an editor to set applications
directories.

The appdir('info') command will tell you the number of application directories
that are currently enabled. This value can be returned to a parameter as in

appdir('info'):$num

The label and path of a specific application directory can be returned
by supplying a number after the 'info' keyword. The number must be between
1 and the total number of applications directories ($num from above).
As an example, the following macro lists the current applications directories.

clear
write('alpha','Applications Directories')
appdir('info'):$num
$i = 0
while ($i < $num) do
  $i=$i+1
  appdir('info',$i):$label,$path
  if ($label = '') then
    write('alpha','%d: "appdir %d" has path "%s"',$i,$i,$path)
  else
    write('alpha','%d: "%s" has path "%s"',$i,$label,$path)
  endif
endwhile

See the "which" macro for another example of the use of the appdir command.

The appdir('index',directory) command will tell you if a specified directory
is an "application directory".  If the supplied directory name is in the list
of "appdirs", its index will be returned. Index 1 is the first appdir. If a 0
is returned, then the supplied directory is not a current appdir.

Example

appdir('index','/vnmr'):$index            // By default, /vnmr is the second appdir,
                                          // so $index would be set to 2
appdir('index','/vnmr/autotest'):$index   // $index could be set to 0 if the autotest 
                                          // appdir is currently Disabled
