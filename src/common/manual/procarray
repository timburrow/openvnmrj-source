 procarray - Process arrayed 1D spectra (M)

      Syntax: procarray

 Description: "procarray" is a "generic" macro for processing arrayed 1D data.
	      It is called within the "procplot" macro, but can also be used "by
	      hand". It will transform all traces, phase up the one with the
	      largest signal, scale them appropriately and set up the display
	      parameters, such that the data could be plotted directly. The
	      plotting itself is done in a separate macro "plarray" that is
	      also called in the "procplot" macro.
	      For the display setup "procarray" distinguishes between arrays
	      with few elements (6 or less), which will be stacked vertically
	      (no horizontal offset), and spectra with many (over 6) elements.
	      Those are stacked horizontally by default, unless there are too
	      many lines, in which case a diagonally stacked display is chosen.
	      Horizontal stacking is mostly adequate for pulse and power cali-
	      brations, where there are usually few lines only; diagonally
	      stacked displays/plots are frequently chosen for T1/T2 experi-
	      ments on entire spectra, often with many lines.
	      The automatic stacking mode can be overridden by creating and
	      setting a string parameter "stackmode" in the startup macro, or
	      before calling "procplot" or "procarray". Possible values for
	      "stackmode" are 'horizontal','vertical', or 'diagonal'.
	      "dept" type spectra can in principle also be processed with
	      "procarray", but of course no dept editing will occur.
