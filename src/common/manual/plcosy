  plcosy   - plot COSY / NOESY type spectra automatically	      (macro)
*******************************************************************************


      Syntax: plcosy<(levels<,spacing<,exp1D>>)>
	      plcosy('pos'<,levels<,spacing<,exp1D>>>)
	      plcosy('neg'<,levels<,spacing<,exp1D>>>)


 Description: "plcosy" automatically plots 2D spectra of type cosy / noesy
	      (homonuclear correlated spectra). Features:
	        - it keeps the orientation (f1, f2) of the spectrum on the
	          screen
	        - the plot area is optimized
	        - number of contour levels and their spacing can be selected
	        - negative or positive contours can be suppressed
	        - 1D traces can be plotted along both axes;
	          such 1D traces are taken from a full (or reduced) 1D
	          spectrum in an other experiment, or from a file from
	          within the current experiment.
	        - it also works correctly for expansions
	        - the 1D traces can be suppressed, which allows using
	          a larger area for the 2D spectrum
	        - the 1D spectrum can be in any experiment
	        - with phase-sensitive spectra, if 'pos' or 'neg' are not
	          selected and the plotter has only 1 pen (also for printers
	          like the LaserJet) 7 or the specified number of positive
	          contours are plotted, but only one negative level, to
	          distinguish positive and negative signals.
	      In multi-experiment mode, for the first plot the experiment
	      with the 1D spectrum should be specified (at least if it is
	      not in exp1). From then on, the 1D spectrum will be stored
	      WITHIN the experiment with the 2D spectrum, which allows
	      much faster switching between the spectra and also frees
	      the other (1D) experiment for other tasks. Because of this
	      "internal storage" the "exp1D" argument is not required for
	      subsequent plots.

   Arguments: 'pos' - only plot positive contours
	      'neg' - only plot negative contours
	      levels - the number of contour levels (default: 7 contours).
	      spacing - the spacing between the contours; default: 2.
	      exp1D - the experiment in which the proton 1D spectrum
		      resides; this can be a full 1D spectrum, but the
		      referencing must be the same as for the 2D (see below).
		      A negative number will suppress the proton trace.
		      Default: exp1.

    Examples: plcosy
	      plcosy(12,1.5)
	      plcosy('pos',7,2,3)
	      plcosy(7,2,-1)
	      plcosy('neg')

       Usage: A typical sequence of actions for acquiring and plotting a
	      cosy (or noesy) spectrum stepwise (using the multiexperiment
	      mode) will be as follows:
		- acquire a proton spectrum in exp1
		- enter the text and reference the spectrum NOW (before
		  moving the fid to an other experiment)
		- mf(4) jexp4 wft ... movesw
		- call the macro for the 2D experiment (e.g. "cosy") and
		  acquire the 2D spectrum
		- process the 2D spectrum
		- for plotting with traces type "plcosy" (the defaults fit).
		- for expansions select the expansion within "dconi" and
		  type "plcosy" again.
