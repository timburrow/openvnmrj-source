gHMBCAD: Gradient selected phase sensitive HMBC, adiabatic version

gHMCBAD is a first tier structure experiment because it will reveal for the case
of 1H and 13C all measurable couplings from each 1H to all 13Cs. The combination of
gCOSY, HSQCAD, and gHSQCAD are often all the experiments needed to complete a complex
structural assignment problem. Commonly used for 1H/13C and 1H/15N. For the case
of 1H/15N long-range correlations the operator chooses 15N from the menu for the F1
nucleus on the Acquire -> Default panel. All parameters are read from the probe file
and passed into the experiment for any chosen nuclei provided there are probe file
entries for pwx and pwxlvl for that nucleus.

Note that if 15N is selected as the F1 nucleus the default 15N chemical shift referencing
is the IUPAC convention for CH3NO2 at 0 ppm. If in that account the user does the
following the 15N chemical shift referencing will become NH3 at zero ppm. With the
NH3 reference standard all 15N chemical shifts are positive:
