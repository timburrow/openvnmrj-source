		Acquisition Done and Error Codes
		--------------------------------

 Whenever wbs, wnt, wexp, or werr processing occurs,  the acquisition
 condition which initiated that processing is available from the
 parameter acqstatus.  This acquisition condition is represented by
 two numbers,  a "done" code and an "error" code.  The done code is
 set in acqstatus[1] and the error code is set in acqstatus[2].  Macros
 may take different action depending on the acquisition condition.
 The done codes and error codes are listed below.  As an example,  a
 werr macro could specify special processing if the maximum number
 of transients of accumulated.  The appropriate test in the macro
 would be:

 if (acqstatus[2] = 200) then
    "do special processing,  e.g. dp='y' au"
    endif

 The acquisition error messages printed by Vnmr may be modified by
 creating an "acqerrmsgs" file with substitute messages.  Each line in
 the file contains an error code followed by the text of the desired
 message.  Error codes that do not occur in the acqerrmsgs file will
 continue to produce the standard messages.  Vnmr first searches for
 the acqerrmsgs file in the user's "$vnmruser/templates" directory; if
 the file is not there Vnmr looks the the system directory
 "$vnmrsystem/user_templates".  Entries are taken only from one file
 or the other, their contents are not "merged".  A typical entry in
 the file would be:

 301	Can't spin the spinner


 Error codes marked with an asterisk (*) are not used on Mercury and
 GEMINI 2000
