The linear prediction (LP) algorithms work both on complex t2 FIDs
and on hypercomplex or complex t1 interferograms.


LPALG:

This is a string parameter which specifies the LP algorithm to
be used.  The currently supported algorithms are:  "lpfft" and
"lparfft".

"lpfft" performs a least-squares calculation of "lpfilt" complex
LP coefficients using "lpnupts" complex time-domain data points.
Eigenvalue decomposition of the least-squares matrix is done
using Householder tridiagonalization followed by the QL method
with implicit shifts.  

"lparfft" performs a non-least-squares calculation of "lpfilt"
complex LP coefficients using ["lpfilt"+1] complex, auto-regressive
(AR) matrix elements.  These AR matrix elements are calculated
from the raw, complex time-domain data using "lpnupts" points.

With both of these algorithms, the resulting LP coefficients are
used to appropriately extend the complex time-domain data prior
to a normal FT thereof.  "lpalg" is operative for the "np" dimen-
sion; "lpalg1", for the "ni" dimension; and "lpalg2", for the "ni2"
dimension.

The "lpfft" is by far the preferred algorithm.  While the "lparfft"
algorithm can model broad lines and can extend data sets when mostly
noise exists,  it cannot model narrow lines.


LPOPT:

This is a string parameter which specifies how the specific LP algo-
rithm is to extend (or alter) the time-domain data.  The supported
options are:  'b' and 'f'.  'b' indicates that the LP coefficients
are to be used in the back-calculation of a specified number of time-
domain data points; 'f', that the LP coefficients are to be used in
the forward extension of the time-domain data by a specified number
of points.  "lpopt" is operative for the "np" dimension; "lpopt1",
for the "ni" dimension; and "lpopt2", for the "ni2" dimension.

If "lpopt" is set to 'f', the characteristic polynomial in z space,
derived from the complex LP coefficients, is setup and rooted.  Any
root which is found to lie outside the unit circle is reflected back
into the unit circle.  New complex LP coefficients are then calcu-
lated from these adjusted complex roots.


LPFILT:

This is an integral parameter which specifies the number of complex
LP coefficients to be calculated from a specified region of the time-
domain data.  "lpfilt" should be > 'nsignals' where 'nsignals' is the
number of sinusoidal signals contained in that FID (or interferogram).
"lpfilt" is operative for the "np" dimension; "lpfilt1", for the "ni"  
dimension; and "lpfilt2", for the "ni2" dimension.


LPNUPTS:

This is an integral parameter which specifies the number of complex
time-domain data points to be used in constructing the AR (lpalg =
"lparfft") or least-squares (lpalg = "lpfft") matrix from which the
complex LP coefficients are calculated.  Note that "lpnupts" >=
2*"lpfilt" is required for both algorithms.  "lpnupts" is operative
for the "np" dimension; "lpnupts1", for the "ni" dimension; and
"lpnupts2", for the "ni2" dimension.


STRTLP:

This is an integral parameter which specifies the first complex, time-
domain data point to be used in calculating the complex LP coefficients.
If "lpopt" = 'b', the "strtlp"-th complex time-domain data point and
the ensuing [2*"lpnupts" - 1] data points are used in this calculation.  
If "lpopt" = 'f', the "strtlp"-th complex time-domain data point and 
the preceding [2*"lpnupts" - 1] data points are used in this calculation.
"strtlp" is operative for the "np" dimension; "strtlp1", for the "ni"
dimension; and "strtlp2", for the "ni2" dimension.


LPEXT:

This is an integral parameter which specifies the number of complex
time-domain data points by which the original data is to be extended
(or altered) in either the forward or backward direction.  "lpext"
is constrained such that ["strtext" - "lpext"] >= 0 for "lpopt" = 'b'
and ["strtext" + "lpext" - 1] <= "fn"/2 for "lpopt" = 'f'.  "lpext"
is operative for the "np" dimension; "lpext1", for the "ni" dimension;
and "lpext2", for the "ni2" dimension.  In the np direction
if ["strtext" - "lpext"] = 0 and "lpopt" = 'b' (backwards linear
prediction with calculation of the first point), fpmult will default
to the theoretical value of 0.5 instead of 1.0.


STRTEXT:

This is an integral parameter which specifies inclusively the complex
time-domain data point at which LP data extension (alteration) is to
begin.  "strtext" is necessarily constrained such that 1 < "strtext"
< "np"/2.  "strtext" is operative for the "np" dimension; "strtext1",
for the "ni" dimension; and "strtext2", for the "ni2" dimension.


LPTRACE:

This is an integral parameter which specifies for which spectrum (or
trace) LP output is produced in accordance with the parameter "lpprint".
"lptrace" is operative for the "np" dimension; "lptrace1", for the "ni"  
dimension; and "lptrace2", for the "ni2" dimension.


LPPRINT:

"lpprint" is an integral parameter which is comprised of 5 bit fields.
Each bit field controls an independent output option.


	Bit #	Decimal Value	Function
	-----	-------------	--------

	  0	      1		writes out the LP matrix and Y vector
				from which the LP coefficients are
				calculated

	  1	      2		writes out the LP coefficients which
				have been obtained using either of
				the two supported algorithms

	  2	      4		writes out the LP roots obtained
				from the characteristic polynomial
				derived from the LP coefficients;
				only applies for "lpalg" = 'lpfft'
				and "lpopt" = 'f'

	  3	      8		writes out the original and re-cal-
				culated values for each of the LP
				extended (or altered) complex time-
				domain data points

	  4	     16		writes out the internal LP parameter
				structure
				

For example, "lpprint" = 12 and "lptrace" = 1 yields the following
information in the file 'curexp/lpanalyz.out.1' for spectrum 1 along F2:
the values for all "lpfilt" complex LP coefficients; and the original
and re-calculated values for each of the "lpext" LP extended (or
altered) complex time-domain data points.  "lpprint" is operative
for the "np" dimension and creates an output file in the current
experiment directory (curexp) with the name 'lpanalyz.out.1'.  "lpprint1"
is operative for the "ni" dimension and creates an output file in
the current experiment directory with the name 'lpanalyz1.out.1'.
"lpprint2" is operative for the "ni2" dimension and creates an output
file in the current experiment directory with the name 'lpanalyz2.out.1'.


ARRAYED LP PARAMETERS:

Multiple LP operations can be performed on each FID or interferogram.
This is accomplished by arraying the LP processing parameters.  The
number of LP operations is determined by the LP processing parameter
with the largest array size.  LP parameters having a smaller array size
are padded out with their last value.  The most common use for this
capability is to back-calculate the first 1-2 points in an FID or
interferogram and subsequently to extend the length of the time-domain
data by LP.  A printout can be obtained for each LP operation on an
individually definable FID or interferogram.  For example, if lpprint =
30,30 and lptrace = 1,2, the text file lpanalyz.out.1 contains the LP
printout for the first LP operation on FID 1 and lpanalyz.out.2, the
LP printout for the second LP operation on FID 2.
