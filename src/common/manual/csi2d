CSI2D

CSI in 2 spatial dimensions.
Although this is 2 spatial dimensions, it is a 3D acquisition. There are
2 phase encode dimensions, so that lpe and lpe2 are active. 
There is no readout gradient so that gro is not relevant.

Sequence uses standard imaging parameters.

the additional parameter acqdel delays acquisition so that the half echo
may be collected. This may be set by setting nv=nv2=0 and acquiring.
Then type df, set the cursor on the echo peak, and type
acqdel=crf
For full echo acquisition, acqdel=0

seqcon='nscsn'

Processing will be via the "csi" package.
