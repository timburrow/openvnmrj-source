which(name)	- displays which macro or command is used
*******************************************************************************
 
  Certain Vnmr "commands" are built into the Vnmr program.  The details
  of these commands are not accessible.  Other Vnmr "commands" are really
  Vnmr macros.  The details of the macros are accessible.  They reside
  as text files in one of four possible directories.  A built-in Vnmr
  command always takes precedence over a macro.  For example,  there
  is a Vnmr command named wft.  If someone writes a macro named wft,
  the macro wft will never get executed, since the built-in command
  takes precedence.  [Note: the hidecommand command can be used to
  rename built-in commands, thereby allowing macros to use their names.]

  Macros may reside in four separate places.  In the users maclib,
  in a directory defined by the global parameter maclibpath, in a directory
  defined by the global parameter sysmaclibpath, or in
  the system maclib.  When macros are executed,  those four locations
  are searched in the that order.  The first one found will be the one
  that is used.  For example, rt is a standard Vnmr macro in the system
  maclib.  If a user makes their own rt macro in the user's maclib, the
  user's macro will take precedence over the system macro.

  The which(name) macro displays on line three which command or macro
  of that name will be executed.
