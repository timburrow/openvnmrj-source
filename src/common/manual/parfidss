ssfilter :

This parameter specifies the full bandwidth of the digital filter
that is applied to the original FID to yield a filtered FID.  It
is created as a real, assigned to the "processing" group, and has
limits [10,sw/2] in steps of 0.1 Hz.  The default value is 100 Hz.
By setting this parameter to "Not Used" (ssfilter='n'), both
the zfs and lfs options are turned off.


ssorder :

This parameter specifies the order of the polynomial that is used
to fit the digitally filtered FID if the 'zfs' processing option is
selected. It is not used if the 'lfs' option is selected.  It is
created as an integer, assigned to the "processing" group, and has
limits [1,20].  The default value is "Not Active".  Therefore,
by default, the lfs option is selected.


ssntaps :

This parameter specifies the number of taps (coefficients) to be
used in the digital filter.  The more taps in a filter, the flatter
the passband response and the steeper the transition from passband
to stopband, i.e., the more rectangular the filter.  It is created
as an integer, assigned to the "processing" group, and has limits
[1, np/4].  The default value is 121 and is suitable for use with
the 'lfs' option.  A smaller value of ssntaps (3 <= ssntaps <= 21)
usually works better with the 'zfs' option.  It is generally best
to use an odd number of taps with either option.


sslsfrq :

This parameter specifies the location of the center of the solvent-suppressed
region of the spectrum.  Setting the parameter to 0 or 'n' (the default) will
solvent-suppress a region centered about the transmitter frequency.  A non-zero
value for this parameter will shift the solvent-suppressed region by sslsfrq
Hz.


Example:

  addpar('ss'): creates the parameters ssfilter, ssorder, ssntaps, and sslsfrq.
  parfidss:     creates the parameters ssfilter, ssorder, ssntaps, and sslsfrq.


1D Usage:

In a 1D transform, subtraction of the zero-frequency component from
the time-domain data, usually in the context of solvent subtraction,
is selected by setting ssorder and ssfilter to desired values and
then typing wft.  If ssfilter is set to "Not Used", both the lfs and
zfs options are turned off.  If ssfilter is set to a value, then
the zfs option is selected if ssorder is set to some value.  If
ssorder is set to "Not Used", then the lfs option is selected.


'zfs' leads to the following series of processing events :
    1) The raw FID is frequency-shifted by sslsfrq Hz.
    2) The raw FID is subjected to a low-pass digital filter.
    3) The filtered FID is fit to a polynomial of order 'ssorder'.
    4) The polynomial function is subtracted from the raw FID.
    5) The resulting FID is frequency-shifted by -sslsfrq Hz.

'lfs' leads to the following series of processing events :
    1) The raw FID is frequency-shifted by sslsfrq Hz.
    2) The raw FID is subjected to a low-pass digital filter.
    3) The filtered FID is directly subracted from the raw FID.
    4) The resulting FID is frequency-shifted by -sslsfrq Hz.

The quality of filtering with 'zfs' diminishes rapidly as the solvent
peak moves off the exact center of the digital filter.  It may be
necessary to adjust lsfrq or sslsfrq to move the solvent peak to
within +/- 0.2Hz of the center of the filter to obtain optimal solvent
suppression.  'lfs' is less sensitive to small offsets, but will
typically remove or distort peaks very near to the solvent peak.


2D Usage:

In a 2D transform, this correction to the t2 FIDs is invoked in the same
manner both with the (w)ft1d and (w)ft2d commands and with the (w)ft2da and
(w)ft1da macros.


3D Usage:

Solvent suppression works on t3 FIDs of 3D spectra just like in the 1D and
2D cases.
