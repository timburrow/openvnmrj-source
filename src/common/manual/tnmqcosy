              (transmitter saturation)
   ref: u. piantini, o.w. sorenson, and r.r. ernst,
        j. am. chem. soc. 104:6800-6801 (1982)
        m. rance et al., bbrc 117:479-485 (1983)


 Parameters:

      pw = 90 excitation pulse (at power level tpwr)
   phase = 1,2: HYPERCOMPLEX phase-sensitive experiment
             3: TPPI phase-sensitive experiment
 satmode = 'ynn' saturates during relaxation delay
  satdly = saturation time
  satpwr = saturation power
   sspul = 'y': selects for trim(x)-trim(y) sequence at start of pulse sequence
           'n': normal MQCOSY experiment
      ss = number of steady state pulses; if ss < 0 then -ss
           steady-state transients are performed before EVERY increment;
           if ss > 0, then ss steady-state transients are performed
           before only the first increment.
    qlvl = selects the quantum order for filtering, e.g., 2, 3, etc.
      nt = min:  multiple of 2*qlvl
           max:  multiple of 8*qlvl


 NOTE:  If phase = 3, remember that sw1 must be set to twice the
        desired value.  The 28-february revision included the following
        sequence at the beginning of the pulse sequence:  homospoil -
        90 degree pulse - homospoil.  This should eliminate both the
        DQ-like artifacts in the 2D spectrum and the oscillatory nature
        of the steady-state.  This inclusion is selected if sspul='y'.


 This pulse sequence uses the hardware digital phaseshifter for xmtr
 with direct synthesis RF and the software small-angle phaseshifter
 for xmtr with old-style RF.

NOTE: the tnmqcosy pulse sequence is not supplied with Mercury and GEMINI 2000.
