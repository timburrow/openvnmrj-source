spinner -  start up the interactive spinner control process 
***********************************************************

   The spinner control process (spinner) allows interactive
   setting of the sample spinning speed.  The spinner may also be
   turned off.

   Access control for the spinner is also provided.  One may choose
   to allow the sample spinner to be controlled from within an experiment,
   using the parameter spin and the commands spin, go, ga, or au.
   This is the default behavior.  Alternatively, the spinner
   control process allows one to turn off experiment control of the
   sample spinner.  In this mode, only the spinner control process
   (and acqi and sethw) may set the spinning speed.  This has the
   advantage that, often times, the spin parameter is different in
   different experiments.  Joining a different experiment and typing
   go may unexpectedly change the spinning speed.  This mode prevents
   this. In this mode, when a go. su. ga, or au is entered, the
   spin parameter is first set to the speed selected in the spinner
   window and then the parameter spin is set to "Not Used".

   If the spinning speed is controlled only via the spinner control
   process, then the action to be taken after a spinner failure
   may be selected.  Either a warning is given and the acquisition
   continues, or an error is given and acquisition is stopped.  Note that
   if experiment control of spinning speed is selected, this selection
   of the action to be taken after a spinner failure is provided
   by the parameter in.  Note that in the spinner control process,
   if experiment control of spinning speed is selected, then the
   choices for failure handling are faded, since they are inoperative.

   The interactive spinner process also provides a mechanism to
   select the style of spinner.  A low-speed style or a high-speed style.
   If the high-speed style of spinner (used for solids) is selected,
   then the choice of setting the spinning speed or the air flow rate
   is provided. Setting the air flow rate is useful when setting up
   the solids spinning apparatus.
