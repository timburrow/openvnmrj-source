/* Usage: callacq(arg_string)
 *
 * Utility macro to construct a string to pass to psg via the Acq() command.
 *
 * This macro should be used only by users with advanced knowledge.  A
 * well-constructed argument string is required.  The motivation for this
 * macro is to make the 'go' macro re-entrant, while still synchronizing with
 * VnmrJ.
