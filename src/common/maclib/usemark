"macro usemark"
"usemark - use output from 'mark' command during ds display		"
" as input for deconvolution.  This command runs a shell script		"
" which reformats the file ds.out into the proper form for		"
" fitspec.inpar.  The Mark button may either be used when a single	"
" cursor is present, in which case usemark takes a linewidth from	"
" the parameter slw, or it may be used when two cursors are present.	"
" In this case, the two cursors should be placed symmetrically about	"
" the center of each line before 'Mark' is hit.  Usemark will take	"
" the center of the two cursors as the input frequency, and the		"
" difference of the two cursors as the starting linewidth."
