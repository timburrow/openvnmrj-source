"macro fixup"
" fixup - fix tof, dof, rfl, rfp "
" on systems in which the lock frequency can be and has been	"
" changed (typically 400's and 500's but including some 300's)	"
" the frequencies returned by the setup program are incorrect.	"
" most often, rfl will be wrong, providing incorrect		"
" automatic referencing.  however it can also be that tof or	"
" dof are also wrong, such that the spectrum is really not	"
" correctly positioned. "
 
" fixup is a macro which is called by the experiment setup	"
" macros h1, c13, hexp, hc, hcapt, capt, and hcosy.  as		"
" provided it is all in quotes and does nothing.  however it	"
" provides each user a mechanism to make adjustments to the	"
" values selected by setup. You must enter numbers which	"
" accomplish your task. "
