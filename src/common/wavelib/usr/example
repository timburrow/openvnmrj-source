# equation evaluator test file; creates sech pulse. 
# constants must be real numbers, e.g. pi = M_PI is not allowed
# constants must start with a letter, e.g. pi2 is OK, 2pi is not.
# |a1 + b| not allowed. must be fabs(a1 + b)
# {} and [] may be used for clarity
# t is the time variable changing from 0 to 1 (from 0 to pw)
# only one line of equation is accepted
# equation must be terminated with ';'
# phase modulation is also allowed
# if pwbw and adb is defined - will calibrate for fmf (not pmf) 
# either frequency (fmf) or phase (pmf) modulation function is
# defined, NOT both. An example of pmf is commented out below
# pmf = (a2/a1)*ln(fabs(sech(a1*(1.0-2*t))));

fmf = a2*tanh(a1*(1.0-2*t));
a1    =   4.605170 (constant, defines the truncation level)
a2    = -31.4159   (constant, defines modulation depth)
fla   = 180.0      (flip angle on resonance)
steps = 500        (default number of steps)
pwbw  =  20.0      (pulse width to band width product)
adb   =   4.0      (adiabaticity parameter)
