# amwurst: WURST shaped adiabatic off-resonance spin lock pulse
# H. Desvaux et al, J.Magn.Reson., 113A, 47 (1995).
# To be used with frequency switching. 
# Calibration is given as for 180 deg flip angle on-resonance.
# However, the actual B1 field has to be adjusted according to the 
# carrier frequency and the required spin-lock conditions (tilt angle)

amf 	= wr	(amplitude modulation function)
fla 	= 180.0	(tipangle on resonance)
pwbw 	= 0.5	(pulsewidth to bandwidth product)
c1      = 40.0  (power index, n)
dash    = c1    (dash parameter)
steps 	= 100	(default number of steps)
