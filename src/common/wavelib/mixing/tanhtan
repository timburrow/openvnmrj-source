# Calibration is given assuming adiabaticity of 10. However,
# the actual B1 field has to be adjusted according to the carrier 
# frequency and the required spin-lock conditions (tilt angle)

fmf 	= tns	(frequency modulation function)
fla 	= 180.0	(default flipangle on resonance)
pwbw 	= 12.3	(pulsewidth to bandwidth product)
adb     = 10.0  (adiabaticity on resonance)
c1      = 0.95  (angular truncation constant, 0 < c1 < 1)
steps 	= 500	(default number of steps)
wf      = hta   (window function)
srev    = 0.5   (sweep reversal)
