# This file maintains Collections, and Custom parlib filenames
# The first column represent the group.  The 2nd column the name
#   and the subsequent part of the line the elements
# This file is managed on-the-fly by the editparlib/mkcollection macros
# For Collections, this is the source of its elements
# For CustomEXPs, the element represents the parent experiment (pslabel)
# ****Generally this file should not be edited manually****

# But if you opt to do so, make sure the first and the 2nd 
# columns have a colon (:) appended to them
