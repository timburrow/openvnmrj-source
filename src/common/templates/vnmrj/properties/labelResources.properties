#
# labelResources is resource bundle for labels in VnmrJ xml files.
# labelResources is broken to two files: labelResources.properties
# and labelResources2.properties. This is the first file.
#
# The format of property file is key=value, or `key`=`value`.
# Left side of equal sign is the key. In this case they are labels
# in xml files. Right side is the value, which is what will be displayed.
# if right side is missing, key will be used as value.
# Single quotation `...` (NOTE, it is not '...'), is useful if the label
# starts with #, or contains = sign.
#
# For English language, value and key are often identical. Default
# property files are only needed if you need to change the English
# label without disturbing the other translations, or if two objects
# have the same English label but different labels in another
# language.
#
# For non-English language such as Japanese, copy
# labelResources.list to labelResources_ja.properties, and put
# your translation to the right side.
#
# Resource bundle search for a match in labelResources_ja.properties.
# If not found, it search labelResources2_ja.properties.
# New labels should be added to the end of the second file
