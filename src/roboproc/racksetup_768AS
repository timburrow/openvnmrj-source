# Template of Gilson Rack & Sample Setup file created
#   and/or modified by the gilson configurator program
#
# Modified to apply to the 215SW which has a taller Z arm
#  and smaller X-dimension.
#  - The X-position of the injector location changes since
#    it is mounted at the farthest end of the X dimension.
#  - The X-position of the Rack1 center changes since it
#    is positioned differently on the bed and the minimum
#    X-position is -329 instead of 0.
