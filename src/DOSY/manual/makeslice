NAME
	makeslice (C)

SYNOPSIS
	makeslice(d1,d2)
	makeslice(mode,d1,d2)

DESCRIPTION 
	The makeslice command synthesises an integral projection between
specified diffusion limits of a 3D DOSY spectrum onto the frequency * frequency
plane.  It requires the first 2D increment of the 3D DOSY data to have been
transformed.

OPTIONS
	The makeslice command requires two arguments d1 and d2, the limits in
units of 10**-10 m2/s between which integration is required. An optional
extra argument mode ('i' or 's') may precede d1 and d2;  's' only includes in
the integration peaks whose diffusion coefficient lies between the specified
limits, whereas 'i' includes the 'tails' of diffusion peaks which lie outside
the range between d1 and d2.  The default mode is 'i'.
