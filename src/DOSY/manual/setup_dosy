NAME
	setup_dosy (M)	

SYNOPSIS
	setup_dosy
	setup_dosy(n)
	setup_dosy(n,gmin,gmax)
	setup_dosy('panelread')

DESCRIPTION 
	setup_dosy initialises DOSY parameters with makedosyparams, and sets 
up an array of n values of gzlvl1 ranging from gmin to gmax in approximately
equal steps of gradient squared, rounded to the nearest 5 DAC points.
Called with no arguments it initiates a dialogue to establish n, gmin and 
gmax; with one numercial argument it uses n equal steps up to 20% below maximum
gradient, and with three numercial arguments it uses n equal steps from gmin to
gmax, all rounded to the nearest 5 DAC points. If called with the 'panelread'
argument, setup_dosy reads the values of n, gmin and gmax from the 'Acquire-Defaults'
and/or 'Acquire-Pulse Sequence' panels.


OPTIONS
	0, 1 or 3 arguments as above.
