		the measured gradient and signal maps in non-uniform gradient

NAME
	decay_gen (C)

SYNOPSIS
	decay_gen(D,ngrads)

DESCRIPTION
	decay_gen takes the measured signal profile and gradient map as a 
function of position and calculates the predicted signal attenuation as a 
function of gradient strength.

OPTIONS
	decay_gen takes two arguments: the diffusion coefficient (D) of the
calibrant, and the number of gradient levels (ngrads) for which the attenuation
is to be calculated. decay_gen is normally run only by the nugcalib macro.
