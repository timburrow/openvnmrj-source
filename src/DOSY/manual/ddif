NAME
	ddif (C)

SYNOPSIS
	ddif(mode)
	ddif(d1,d2)
	ddif(mode,d1,d2)

DESCRIPTION 
	ddif synthesises a 2D DOSY spectrum from the current 1D spectrum, using
a file containing diffusion data from either (multi)exponential or CONTIN fitting. 
It is normally run by the dosy macro, but may be run directly, for example to 
recalculate a 2D DOSY spectrum with different digitization. When running directly, 
first set fn and fn1 as desired and transform the first increment of the DOSY 
datset.  After 'dosy' or 'ddif', the original 1D data are overwritten by 
the 2D (the dosy macro keeps a copy of the 1D data, which can be retrieved with
the command 'undosy'; similarly, once a DOSY spectrum has been calculated it can
be retrieved with the command 'redosy').

OPTIONS
	At least one argument (mode) is required, either 'i' for a display in
which the 2D peak volume is proportional to 1D peak height, or 'c' for a display
in which the 2D peak height equals the 1D.  Two further arguments d1 and d2 may
be added, as for the macro dosy, to specify the diffusion limits (in units of
10**-10 m2/s) between which the spectrum should be synthesised (i.e. the F1
spectral width).  If these arguments are not supplied, ddif defaults to
displaying the full range of diffusion coefficients in the file
diffusion_display.inp in the current experiment.
