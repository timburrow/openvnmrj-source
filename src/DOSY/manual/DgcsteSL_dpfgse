DgcsteSL_dpfgse - Stimulated echo sequence with self-compensating gradient schemes
             using DPFGSE solvent suppression method

  Parameters:
	delflag   - 'y' runs the DgcsteSL_dpfgse sequence
                    'n' runs the normal s2pul sequence
        del       -  the actual diffusion delay
        gt1       - total diffusion-encoding pulse width
        gzlvl1    - diffusion-encoding pulse strength
        gstab     - gradient stabilization delay (~0.0002-0.0003 sec)
	tweek     - tuning factor for limiting eddy currents, 
                   ( can be set from 0 to 1, usually set to 0.0 )
        prg_flg   - 'y' selects purging pulse (default)
                    'n' omits purging pulse
	prgtime   - purging pulse length (~0.002 sec)
	prgpwr    - purging pulse power	
	lkgate_flg  - lock gating flag, if set to 'y', the lock is gated off
			during gradient pulses (default = 'n')
        satmode   - 'y' turns on presaturation
        wrefshape   - shape file of the 180 deg. selective refocussing pulse
                        on the solvent (may be convoluted for multiple solvents)
        wrefpw      - pulse width for wrefshape (as given by Pbox)
        wrefpwr     - power level for wrefshape (as given by Pbox)
        wrefpwrf    - fine power for wrefshape by default it is 2048
                        needs optimization for multiple solvent suppression only
                                with fixed wrefpw
        gt2         - gradient duration for the solvent suppression echo
        gzlvl2      - gradient power for the solvent suppression echo
        alt_grd     - alternate gradient sign(s) in dpfgse on even transients
                        (default = 'n')
        gstab       - gradient stabilization delay
        sspul     - flag for a GRD-90-GRD homospoil block
        gzlvlhs   - gradient level for sspul
        hsgt      - gradient duration for sspul
        ncomp     - determines the number of components to be used in fitting
                        the signal decay in DOSY when dosyproc='discrete'.
        nugflag   - 'n' uses simple mono- or multi-exponential fitting to
                          estimate diffusion coefficients
                    'y' uses a modified Stejskal-Tanner equation in which the
                          exponent is replaced by a power series
     nugcal_[1-5] - a 5 membered parameter array summarising the results of a
                        calibration of non-uniform field gradients. Used if
                        nugcal is set to 'y'
                        requires a preliminary NUG-calibration by the 
                        Doneshot_nugmap sequence
        dosyproc  - 'discrete' - invokes monoexponential fitting with dosyfit if 
                        ncomp=1, and multiexponential fitting with the external
                        programme SPLMOD if ncomp>1.
                    'continuous' invokes processing with the external programme
                        CONTIN and gives a continuous distribution
                        in the diffusion domain.
     dosypypoints - 'n' divides the spectrum into individual peaks, creating one 
                        cross-peak for each individual peak found in the 1D spectrum
                    'y' performs a diffusion fit for every point in the displayed
                        region of the spectrum that lies above the threshold th
           probe_ - stores the probe name used for the dosy experiment

The water refocussing shape can be created/updatedted using the "update_wrefshape"
macro.
