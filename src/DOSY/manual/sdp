NAME
	sdp (M)

SYNOPSIS
	sdp
	sdp(n)

DESCRIPTION
	Constructs a diffusion spectrum equivalent to the projection of the 
current 2D or 3D DOSY spectrum onto the diffusion axis, but with high digital 
resolution, either in the current experiment (no argument) or in experiment n.
If no argument is given the original data may be recovered with the macro 
undosy, or the DOSY spectrum with redosy.

OPTIONS
	This macro takes one optional argument which is the number of the
experiment in which the dosy projection should be displayed.
