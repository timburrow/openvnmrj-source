NAME
	gradfit (C)

SYNOPSIS
	gradfit(lowfrq,highfrq,D)
	gradfit(lowfrq,highfrq,D,ncoef)

DESCRIPTION
	gradfit calculates the coefficients of a power series to fit the 
measured variation of gradient strength with position during the calibration of
non-uniform pulsed field gradients.

OPTIONS
	gradfit takes 3 or 4 arguments: lowfrq is the lower frequency limit of
the signal profile, highfrq the high frequency limit, D the diffusion 
coefficient of the calibrant, and ncoef is the number of coefficients in the 
power series (default is 8)
