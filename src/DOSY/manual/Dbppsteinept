Parameters:
	delflag - 'y' runs dosyinept
		  'n' runs normal inept without dosy
	del     - the actual diffusion delay
	gt1     - total length of the phase encoding gradient
	gzlvl1  - stenght of the phase encoding gradient
        pp      - 90 deg. hard 1H pulse
        pplvl   - decoupler power level for pp pulses
        sspul   - flag for a GRD-90-GRD homospoil block
        gzlvlhs - gradient level for sspul
        hsgt    - gradient duration for sspul
        sspulX  - flag for a GRD-90-GRD homospoil block during del
                   to destroy original X magnetization (using hsgt and gzlvlhs)
        j1xh    - one-bond X-H coupling
        mult    - multiplicity; 1   selects ch's (doublets);
                                1.5 gives ch2's down, ch's and ch3's up;
                                0.5 enhances all protonated carbons
       alt_grd  - flag to invert gradient sign on alternating scans
                        (default = 'n')
     lkgate_flg - flag to gate the lock sampling off  during
                              gradient pulses
      ncomp     - determines the number of components to be used in fitting
                      the signal decay in DOSY when dosyproc='discrete'.
      nugflag   - 'n' uses simple mono- or multi-exponential fitting to
                       estimate diffusion coefficients
                  'y' uses a modified Stejskal-Tanner equation in which the
                       exponent is replaced by a power series
   nugcal_[1-5] - a 5 membered parameter array summarising the results of a
                     calibration of non-uniform field gradients. Used if
                     nugcal is set to 'y'
                     requires a preliminary NUG-calibration by the 
                     Doneshot_nugmap sequence
      dosyproc  - 'discrete' - invokes monoexponential fitting with dosyfit if 
                     ncomp=1, and multiexponential fitting with the external
                     programme SPLMOD if ncomp>1.
                  'continuous' invokes processing with the external programme
                     CONTIN and gives a continuous distribution
                     in the diffusion domain.
   dosypypoints - 'n' divides the spectrum into individual peaks, creating one 
                     cross-peak for each individual peak found in the 1D spectrum
                  'y' performs a diffusion fit for every point in the displayed
                     region of the spectrum that lies above the threshold th
         probe_ - stores the probe name used for the dosy experiment
