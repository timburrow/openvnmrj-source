Z gradient mapping sequence based on the Oneshot pulse sequence
	allows measurement of phase sensitive or absolute value profiles

  Parameters:
        delflag   - 'y' runs Doneshot_nugmap sequence
                    'n' runs a normal s2pul sequence
        avflag    - 'n' runs Doneshot sequence with a read gradient
                  - 'y' as above plus an increased gradient pulse top move the echo to the middle of at
	del       -  the actual diffusion delay.
	gt1       - total diffusion-encoding pulse width.
        gzlvl1    - diffusion-encoding pulse strength
        gstab     - gradient stabilization delay
        gt3       - spoiling gradient duration
        gzlvl3    - spoiling gradient strength
        gzlvl_max - maximun accepted gradient strength
                       32767 with PerformaII, 2047 with PerformaI
        gzlvl_read- gradient strength during acquisition, typically around 25 DAC points
        kappa     - unbalancing factor between bipolar pulses as a
                       proportion of gradient strength (~0.2)
        tweak     - correction to final gradient pulse, typically around -1 DAC point
        awm       - 0 selects absolute value experiment
                    1 selects phase sensitive experiment
     nugcal_[1-5] - a 5 membered parameter array summarising the results of a
                        calibration of non-uniform field gradients.
                        Created by the Doneshot_nugmap sequence
           probe_ - stores the probe name used for the dosy experiment

Select tof to be on-resonance on the hdo signal.
The parameters for the heating gradients (gt4, gzlvl4) are calculated
in the sequence. They cannot be set directly.
