NAME
	dosy (M)

SYNOPSIS
	dosy('prune')   
 	dosy(d1,d2) 
 	dosy('prune',d1,d2)  

DESCRIPTION 
	dosy fits the data from a PFG diffusion NMR experiment (aka DOSY
experiment) and produces either a 2D DOSY spectrum (for 2D data, dosy3Dproc='n') 
or a 2D spectrum annotated with diffusion coefficients (for 3D data, 
dosy3Dproc='y'). 
	In 2D mode, dosy either uses the command dll to identify all signals 
above the threshold defined by the parameter 'th' (if dosybypoints='n') or (if 
dosybypoints='y') treats each point above th in the spectrum as a separate peak.
fp is then used to determine the height of each peak in successive spectra, 
storing the data in the file dosy_in. If dosyproc='discrete', the data are then 
processed with the command dosyfit if ncomp=1, or passed via the command 
splmod_prepare to the external programme SPLMOD if ncomp>1.  If 
dosyproc= 'continuous', the data are passed via the command contin_prepare to 
the external programme CONTIN. The results of fitting are then converted by 
the command ddif into a 2D dataset for display by dconi. The digital resolution 
in the second dimension is determined by n1; for dosyproc='discrete', fn1 is 
typically 512 or 1024, but for dosyproc='continuous', processing times may 
become prohibitive for fn1>256.
	In 3D mode, dosy requires the 2D cross-peaks of interest to have been
marked, either manually or automatically. dosy takes the list of marked peaks,
compiles the peak volumes into the file dosy_in, and passes this to the 
command dosyfit which determines the diffusion coefficients and labels the
2D spectrum appropriately. 2D projections of the 3D DOSY spectrum between 
different diffusion limits may be calculated using the command makeslice. 
dosy does not currently support dosyproc='continuous' or ncomp>1.

OPTIONS
	dosy takes the optional arguments 'prune', d1 and d2, where d1 and d2 
are minimum and and maximum values for the diffusion display. The argument 
'prune' causes dosy to enter a dialog with the user to determine which
gradient levels should be pruned, i.e. omitted from the analysis.
