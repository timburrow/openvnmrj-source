wetdqcosy - macro for creating wetdqcosy parameters from a WET parameter set
        (see the dglc parameter screen)
*************************************************************

  wet - a y/n flag determining whether the WET element is used
        (which uses pwwet, wetpwr, wetshape, gtw, gzlvlw, and gswet).
  wetpwr - the power level for the WET element.
  pwwet - the pw90 pulse width at wetpwr.
  wetshape - the pulse shape used during the wet element.
  gtw - the duration of the spoiling gradient (in sec).
  gzlvlw - the amplitude of the gtw gradient. 
  gswet - the recovery time following each gradient (try 0.002).

  c13wet - a y/n flag controlling the selective 13C decoupling used during WET
        (which uses dorwet, dpwrwet, and dmfwet; hardcoded to be WALTZ).
  dofwet - the 13C decoupler offset used during WET.
  dpwrwet - the decoupler power level for c13wet.
  dmfwet - the dmf value used for c13wet.

  dz - the delay following the wet element to allow longitudinal recovery
        (like a T1IR or WEFT inversion recovering through zero).
  composit - a y/n flag determining whether a composite read pulse is used.

PW = 90 degree pulse on the observed nucleus
D1 = relaxation delay  (1-3*T1)
D2 = evolution time (t1 period)
AT = acquisition time (t2 period)
SW = spectral width (usually SW1 = SW, except for PHASE = 3)
NI = number of t1 increments (set so that SW1/NI = 12)
PHASE = 1,2  (suggested value)

NOTE:  For PHASE = 3, remember that sw1 = 2*sw (for homonuclear
       experiments) or that sw1 must be set to TWICE the desired
       value (for heteronuclear experiments).

SSPUL = 'y':  activates a homospoil-90-homospoil sequence which
              precedes D1; used to achieve a less oscillatory
              steady-state for 2D experiments where the recycle
              time is shorter than T1.
              Note: homospoil is not available on GEMINI 2000,
                    therefore SSPUL is ignored.

SS = number of steady-state transients;  if ss < 0, then -ss
     transients (with phasecycling of pulses and receiver) are
     performed before EACH experiment in either an arrayed or 2D
     experiment; if ss > 0, then ss transients are performed before
     only the first experiment in such cases.

PRESAT = decoupler presaturation period using a decoupler power
         specified by DHP or DPWR; does not depend on DM but does
	 depend on DMM; activated as a part of D1 if PRESAT > 0.
	 Note: PRESAT is ignored on GEMINI 2000. No presaturation
               is done.

NT = multiple of 16 (PHASE = 0)  (minimum)
     multiple of  8 (PHASE = 1,2 or 3)  (minimum)



v1  = phasecycle for first PW pulse
v2  = phasecycle for second PW pulse
v3  = phasecycle for third PW pulse
oph = phasecycle for receiver

v1  =  x  x  x  x  y  y  y  y  x  x  x  x  y  y  y  y
      -x -x -x -x -y -y -y -y -x -x -x -x -y -y -y -y

v2  =  x  x  x  x  y  y  y  y -x -x -x -x -y -y -y -y

v3  =  x  y -x -y  y -x -y  x

oph =  x -y -x  y  y  x -y -x -x  y  x -y -y -x  y  x
      -x  y  x -y -y -x  y  x  x -y -x  y  y  x -y -x


These phases are for PHASE = 1.  For PHASE = 2, add 90 degrees
to v1.  For PHASE = 3, add 90*(ix - 1) degrees to v1 where ix
is the increment counter.  For PHASE = 0, the subcycle for P-type
peak selection is added in after the basic 4-step cycle of v3.

PHASE =   0:  2D data for AV display (P-type peaks)
PHASE = 1,2:  2D hypercomplex data (States-Haberkorn method)
PHASE =   3:  2D TPPI data

NOTE: This pulsequence is not supplied with Mercury or GEMINI 2000
