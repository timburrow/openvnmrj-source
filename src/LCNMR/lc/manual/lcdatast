lcdatast - An LC-NMR plotting and display macro.
*******************************************************************************

The engine for display and plotting of LC detector data.
The default mode is a horizontal display of detector 1.  Stop codes are marked if
encountered in the LC data.  The following arguments are recognized and
any number can be entered in any order.

plot    sends output to plotter.

side    activates vertical display on the side of the NMR data.  In this mode the LC da
ta are positioned between wc and wcmax and scaled appropriately to fit.  In the stopped
-flow mode, the side option also places the stopped-flow NMR data at a position so that
 it is time-aligned with the relevant LC peak.

det2    displays or plots the outputs of detectors one and two.

full    The detector data is displayed vertically at sc.

Example:  lcdatast(<arguments>)
