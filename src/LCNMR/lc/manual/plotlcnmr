plotlcnmr - an LC-NMR plotting macro.
*******************************************************************************
The NMR data for a particular peak can be plotted using plotlcnmr
with the number of the peak as an argument.  While this can also be
accomplished with the pl command, plotlcnmr labels the plot with the LC
retention time of the peak and the Cascade file name associated with the LC data.
