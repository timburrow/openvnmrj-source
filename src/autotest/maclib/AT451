"AT451 Stability of 2H pw90 using Lock/Decoupler. The 2H rf is routed"   
"      to 2H Automation Relay which sends it to the diplexer box and"
"      then to lock BNC on the probe. Thus the calibration is valid for 2H "
"      pw90 or decoupling rf field when using lock/decoupler for 2H"

"      AT450 macro must have run to establish calibrations before this test is used"


"  Either of two methods must be used for this test to run properly "

"  Method #1: Disable Relay
"  In order to use this test, the cable connected to port 14 "
"  on the Magnet Relay Driver Board in the magnet leg has to be disconnected. "
"  This cable drives the Deuterium Automation Relay (K5020) at the back of the "
"  magnet leg (look for the label on the driver cable). The cable connection "
"  is made on a small circuit board mounted next to the manual sample eject "
"  control. This permits the 2H pulse to be delivered by the 2H decoupler, even "
"  when using tn=lk for 2H observe. Otherwise, the relay switches to route the "
"  first broadband amplifier to the lowband module for low band observe. "

"  Method #2: Re-route Decoupler RF
"  Move the Decoupler cable from the top of relay K5022 at the back of the magnet "
"  leg to the bottom position of relay K5022. This will permit the RF to proceed to
"  the lock diplexer box when tn=lk"

"  In either case remember to restore the cable to normal position after the test"
