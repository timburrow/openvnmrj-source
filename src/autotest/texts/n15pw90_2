15N pw90 Determination 

The pw90 is determined by finding a
maximum as a function of pwx in a
HMQC first increment. The signal
is from the CH3C15N and relies
upon coherence transfer using the
three-bond JNH coupling(~1.7 Hz).

The experiment uses channel 3 for the
15N rf with cabling of the third
channel connected to the coil tuned
to 15N.

The first maximum occurs at pwN15=90
degrees.
