15N Power Control Using Channel 3

Overall power control is accomplished using PIN 
diode-controlled RF attenuators.These are precision 
devices that should have negligible phase change 
throughout their full range. The amplitude 
response should also be logarithmic.

pwx360's are determined at each power level.

The pwx90 and B1 vs pwxlvl plots show the expected
exponential performance determined by the attenuator.
The log regression analysis shows the extent of fit 
to the ideal.
