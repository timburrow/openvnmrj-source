13 Degree Test using Phase-Ramped(SLP) Pulses

The normal 13 degree test uses rectangular on-resonance 
pluses that are placed 37 Hz away from the water resonance. 
These are controlled by the pulse programmer. The
shaped pulse 13 degree tests use an on-resonance
shaped pulse in place of the rectangular pulse. 
In this case the pulses are amplitude-modulated in a
gaussian manner. No phase modulation is done
for a normal gaussian shape.

If the phase of the pulse is varied while the pulse 
is being executed, the effective frequency of the pulse
pulse is changed. This can be accomplished using
a shaped pulse and the position of the 
exctiation maximum is under operator control. The
The frequency synthesizer never changes frequency and 
the reference frequency (L.O.) going the the mixer 
remains the same.

SLP pulses are used extensively in selective excitation 
experiments, multiple selective excitation, 1D versions
of 2D experiments, triple-resonance experiments using
multiply-labeled proteins and many other experiments. This
test verifys that use of a phase-modulated pulse does 
not introduce any new instability.
