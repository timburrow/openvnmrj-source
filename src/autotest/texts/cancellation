Cancellation Test

This tests the reproducibility of the rf for cancellation 
experiments. This simple test compares the signal from a
single pulse (4 single transients) with 4 two-transient
and 4 four-transient experiments. The phase of the pulse
is held constant. The receiver is cycled 0,180 and 
0,90,180,270 for the two-and four-transient experiments.
These last two experiments should result
in signal cancellation.

The x100 vertical expansion permits measurement 
of the residual signals.
