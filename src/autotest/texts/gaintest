Receiver Gain Test

Receiver gain is selectable in a logarthmic manner 
(in dB). In an ideal case variation of receiver 
gain should produce a logarithmic dependence of signal 
strength. This is shown by this series of experiments 
in which the gain is varied for otherwise identical 
experiments. The signal dependence on gain is 
clearly verified and quantified by the log 
regression analysis.

A series of stacked plots in which the strong signal 
is forced to be of identical height shows the noise 
behavior as a function of gain. As the gain 
is lowered, the noise becomes dominated by noise 
generated in the ADC's, not in the preamp and probe. 
Regardless of the signal strength, operation in this 
range of gain will produce poorer s/n. 

The only reason to operate in the lower gain region 
is that the signal is strong enough to "clip" the ADC's 
at normal gain. This is a case of "high dynamic 
range". At 600 MHz in a 5mm probe (1H observe), this 
would require a sample of ~50mg of organic material.

The data also show that gain level above which 
additional gain produces no additional improvement.
