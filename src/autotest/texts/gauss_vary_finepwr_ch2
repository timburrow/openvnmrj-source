Amplitude Scaling of Shaped Pulse

Any shaped pulse may be written to take up the full
amplitude range in its shapelib file. This gives the
the best dynamic range and produces the highest level
of accuracy. The actual amplitude is set by the course
attenuator (1 dB steps) and by any fine power control
desired by the operator. If such a parameter is
present, the shaped pulse will be scaled accordingly.
Such a scaling paramter runs in a linear fashion from
4095 (no attenuation) to 0 (about a factor of
1000 in attenuation). These data show a linear
amplitude scaling of a short gaussian pulse using an
arrayed fine power amplitude control parameter. 

For this test, the gaussian pulse is either 
controlled by a waveform generator(if present)
or by dirct pulse sequence control.
