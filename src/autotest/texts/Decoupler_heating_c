Sample Heating During 13C Broadband Decoupling

One of the most important aspect of probe design is the ability of the
probe to handle high-power broadband X decoupling and at the same time
minimize the associated sample heating.

This test uses a "typical" value of 13C decoupling field strength to
accomplish broadband decoupling using an RF field strength adequate to
cover a 160ppm 13C range.

The decoupling is used prior to acquisition for 75 msec  with a repetition
time of 1.5 seconds (typical conditions for indirect detection experiments).
Single transients are used and the chemical shift of one of the methanol
doublet lines is used to indicate the temperature change (0.011536 ppm/degree 
as determined on this sample).

The data indicate the rate of change of the temperature, the homogeneity of
the temperature during the heating (indicated by the stability of linewidth),
the amount of total heating (indicated by the maximum shift in the resonance),
and the length of time necessary to come to equilibrium.
