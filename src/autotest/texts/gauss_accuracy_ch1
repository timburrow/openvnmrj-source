Shaped Pulse Accuracy
The most demanding test of shaped pulse accuracy 
is the ideality of the NMR data following a shaped 
pulse. This test determines the accuracy of a gaussian 
pulse by examination of the off-resonance excitation. 
This is done by repeating the same single-pulse 
excitation while varying the transmitter position 
through a wide range.



The stacked array of data shows the magnitude of 
excitation as a function of offset from resonance. 
In the ideal case this excitation envelope would 
also be gaussian. Any non-gaussian nature of the 
pulse-AS DELIVERED TO THE PROBE- would be 
represented by a convolution of excitation envelopes. 
For example, if the power were not delivered in a 
linear manner, producing some rectangular nature, 
the excitation envelope would have some sinx/x nature, 
producing characteristic sinc "wiggles". The lack of 
such non-gaussian behavior is a direct measure of 
the accuracy with which the hardware can deliver an 
ideal shape to the nuclei.

For this test, the gaussian pulse is either 
controlled by a waveform generator(if present)
or by dirct pulse sequence control.
