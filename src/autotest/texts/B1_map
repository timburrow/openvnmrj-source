RF Homogeneity Test: 1H B1 Map
	
This tests the homogeneity of the RF field strength
throughout the active region of the sample. NMR signal
is acquired in the presence of a field gradient which
spreads the signal along the z-axis, sampling the
active region of the RF coil. The pulse sequence is
simple, just a single pulse that is incremented in a
2D fashion. The 2D transform shows the B1 RF field 
strength (in Hz) along F1, and the spatial z-axis
along F2. The axis is scaled to be in cm.

Perfect RF homogeneity would produce a constant B1
field along the z-axis, with an abrupt change to
B1=0 at the ends of the coil, i.e. a rectangular
shape for the 2D contour plot. The quality of the
probe design is indicated by how close the actual
2D plot conforms to the ideal. This method shows
the B1 field strength at all positions along the
NMR tube, not just the projection of the data which
is obtained by the typical RF homogeneity plot
in which the ration of intensities from 450 degree and
810 degree pulses are compared to that following a
90 degree pulse.

High RF homogeneity is important since many important 
pulse sequences us a large number of pulses. The signal 
losses accumulate with each pulse such that in 
worst cases all the desired signal is lost.
