C13 RF Homogeneity Test
    Using Channel 3

The RF homogeneity of the X coil 
in an indirect detection experiment
can be measured by this experiment.

The first maximum occurs at pwC13=0
degrees. The reduction in intensity
at pwC13=360 and 720 degrees give
a quantitative estimate of RF
homogeneity. This data set uses
finer steps in pwC13 to more
accurately measure the maxima.

The 360/0 and 720/0 ratios are
shimming-dependent. Better shimming
emphasizes the center of the rf coil
where the rf field is more homogeneous.
