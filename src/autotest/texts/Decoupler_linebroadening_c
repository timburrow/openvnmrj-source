Line Broadening from 13C Decoupling

One of the most important aspect of
probe design is the ability of the
probe to handle high-power broadband
X decoupling and at the same time not
produce significant linebroadening

This test uses variable 13C decoupling
field strengths to assess line widths.

Decoupled spectra are acquired over a
16dB range down from the maximum user-
permitted power limit. Sixteen steady-
state transients are used to bring the
sample/coil into equilibrium before a
single transient is obtained at each
power level. Decoupling is performed
for 100msec with a 1.5 second repetition
time.
