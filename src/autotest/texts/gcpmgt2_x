CPMG T2 Using Gradients

The Carr-Purcell Meiboom-Gill T2 experiment
is used to determine spin-spin relaxation.
It involves spinecho periods of short duration
(in this case 2 msec between 180's).

One very severe test of gradients is to do this
test placing gradient pulses within the delays
of the spinecho periods. Here, gradients occupy
50% of the spinecho time. 

Unstable or unmatched gradients will result in
signal loss. T2 measurements with gradients,
without gradients, and with mis-matched gradients
will measure the quality of the gradient pulses.
