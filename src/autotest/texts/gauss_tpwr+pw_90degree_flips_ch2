RF Amplitude Predictability- Gaussian Pulse

The RF attenuator permits choosing of different power
levels to obtain constant flip-angle pulses of different 
pulse lengths. In this case the pulse length was repeatedly 
increased while appropriately reducing power levels by 3 or 6  
dB at a time. The NMR response should be identical as long as
the pulse length is insignificant with respect to T1. 
If the doped water sample has a T1 significantly less
than a hundred milliseconds, there will be
relaxation during the pulse, and hence the
amplitude will drop off the appropriate amount.

For example, if T1 is 50msec and the pulse is 5msec,
relaxation during the pulse will cause a 10% reduction
in the signal amplitude.

For this test, the gaussian pulse is either 
controlled by a waveform generator(if present)
or by dirct pulse sequence control.
