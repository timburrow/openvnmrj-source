Gradient Phase-Cycle Cancellation Test

This tests the reproducibility of the system for 
cancellation experiments that use gradients.
A gradient preceeds a single pulse that is of
constant phase. A comparison is made for
single pulse and four-transient experiments. 
The receiver is cycled 0,2,1,3 and should result
in no signal in two or four transients.

The x100 vertical expansion permits 
measurement of the residual signals.
