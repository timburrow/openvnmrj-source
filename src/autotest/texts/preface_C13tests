***********************  AUTOTEST  ***************************** 
         13C Pulse Power and Decoupling Power are User-Defined

13C Probe Tests:

Determine power level for ~15usec pwX
Determine pwX at this power level and 12dB lower
Determine amplifier compression
Determine 13C rfhomogeneity
   (vary 13C pulse in ..90(1H)..1/2JCH..pwX. Determine 360/0, 720/0)
Measure 13C amplifier linearity by determining pwx360 as function of power
Determine decoupling heating              
Measure Decoupling Bandwidth for Modulators (waltz-16,mlev16,xy32 and garp1)
Measure Decoupling Bandwidth for Waveforms  (wurst and stud)
Measure decoupling stability at High and Low B2 RF fields
Measure effect of 13C,15N and 13C+15N decoupling on Stability, SN and Noise;
