Pulse Shape Test - DANTE

The quality of modern RF is good enough that examination 
of pulse shapes using an oscilloscope is not as informative 
as well-designed and executed NMR tests. 

The turnon and turnoff characteristics of a very short 
pulse are properties that can be measured sensitively by NMR.

The DANTE Test measures the amplitude of a signal following 
a pulse or string of pulses, the sum of which induces the 
same rotation of magnetization. 

If the pulse shape is "ideal" and the total time of the 
pulse train is short relative to T2, the rotation of 
magnetization should be identical. As the pulse length
shortens any non-ideality of pulse shape is revealed as a 
reduction in intensity. 

Here, a series of experiments is performed in which the 
same net signal should be generated. The first spectrum 
is from a single 20us pulse. The second is  
from 10 2us pulses done one after the other, with one 
microsecond in between each pulse. The last one uses 
100 200 nanosecond pulses to achieve the same
nutation. The loss of only a few percent indicates 
that the ideal nature of the rectangular pulse is preserved.
