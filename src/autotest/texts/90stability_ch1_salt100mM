90 Degree Pulse Stability (100mM NaCl Sample)

Modern experiments require very high pulse 
reporducibility to minimize cancellation residuals 
and 't1 noise' in 2D experiments. This tests this 
reproducibility by comparing a series of spectra 
obtained in the same manner: the signal following
a single 90 degree pulse.

The statistical analysis produces an rms deviation 
(in percent of the average peak height). Variations
in phasing are eliminated by using the magnitude mode 
of display.
