H2 90 Degree Pulse Determination using Lock Circuit

This tests calibrates the 2H 90-degree pulse when
using Lock/Decoupler as a transmitter.However,the rf
is routed to the lock circuit in the probe (tn=lk)
instead of the Broadband preamp. The signal is
detected in a normal manner via the lock preamp and
observe mixer/receiver.
