Effects of Oversampling

Oversampling produces improvements in s/n. 
The improvement can be large a given gain, as long
as that gain is low. The only reason to
operate in this gain region is so that the ADC's 
would not be "clipped". This means a high dynamic 
range sample is being used (total number of
protons, solvent plus solute) . 

Oversampling produces 5-60 times the data size as 
normal sampling and would normally be combined with 
Digital Filtering to reduce the stored data size. It 
is important to note that the improvement in s/n 
comes solely from the oversampling. Digital Filtering 
is only used to reduce the data size. 

Most typical applications, even at the highest field 
strengths and in H2O, are for <10mM solutions. These 
concentrations permit use of adequate receiver gain 
and are thus well outside the "high dynamic 
range" regime.
