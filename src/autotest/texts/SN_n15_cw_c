N15 Decoupling Noise Test 

S/N is measured on the water signal as a function
of decoupling power. This is done for no decoupling,
cw decoupling, waltz-16 hardware modulated decoupling,
and waltz-16 waveform generator modulated decoupling.

The power is varied from 1dB to the user-specified upper
limit. S/N and linewidth of the water are measured,
along with the peak height. The noise below is a 3ppm
section of the noise multiplied up in vertical scale.

This data is that acquired with cw decoupling
