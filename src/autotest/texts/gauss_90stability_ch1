Shaped Pulse Amplitude Stability

The linear nature of the system is graphically 
tested by measuring NMR response when the amplitude 
is under full control- both by the RF attenuator 
and by the Linear Modulator. These data are from 
a series of experiments in which the NMR response 
is measured following the application of a single 90 
degree gaussian pulse. The resulting error in 
amplitude should be independent of 90 degree pulse length.
	
For this test, the gaussian pulse is either 
controlled by a waveform generator(if present)
or by dirct pulse sequence control.
