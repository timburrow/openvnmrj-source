C13 RF Homogeneity Test
    Using Channel 3

The RF homogeneity of the X coil 
in an indirect detection experiment
can be measured by this experiment.

The first null occurs at pwC13=90
degrees. The reduction in intensity
at pwC13=360 and 720 degrees give
a quantitative estimate of RF
homogeneity and also checks on 
possible arcing

The observed rf homogeneity is
shimming-dependent. Better shimming
emphasizes the center of the rf coil
where the rf field is more homogeneous.
