30 Degree Pulse Stability

The sinusoidal nature of the excitation profile 
makes the signal generated following a 90 degree 
pulse less sensitive to error than signal 
following a much smaller flip-angle pulse 
(The top of a sine wave is broad and changes in
amplitude less for small changes in flip angle 
than a smaller pulse).A zero degree flip angle 
would have the highest sensitivity to flip angle, but 
of course would give no signal.

A compromise between the extremes of large signal 
following a 90 degree pulse, and no signal following 
a 0 degree pulse is the use of a 30 degree pulse. The 
rms deviation is measured from an array of spectra 
obtained using 30 degree pulses.
