13C Decoupling Profile/Stability

Part 1 of this test shows the effectiveness of 
modulated heteronuclear decoupling over a 
range of 160 ppm. The 13C RF field
strength is constant at 3.5 kHz.

Part2 of this test shows the stability of
the decoupled line when the decoupling
frequency is on-resonance. Performance
is measured and results stored in the
C13DECSTAB autotest history file

Part3 of this test shows the stability of
the decoupled line when the decoupling
frequency is at the end of the decoupling
bandwidth. Performance is measured and the
results stored in the C13DECSTAB autotest
history file.

Failure is defined as intensity which
is below 70% of the "standard" intensity,
which is defined as the average of
20 on-resonance decoupling experiments.
Failure will result in the data being
saved in the data.failed autotest directory.
