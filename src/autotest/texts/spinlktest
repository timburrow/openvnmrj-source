Sample Heating under Spin Lock Conditions

Many modern experiments use spin locks and/or 
decoupling within their pulse sequences. Often, 
the RF fields can cause sample heating. Depending 
on the nature of the probe, this heating can be a 
problem causing baseline artifacts and "t1 noise". 
It is important to quantify the amount of sample 
heating, the speed in attaining a new equilibrium 
temperature, the homogeneity of temperature 
throughout the sample during the heating period 
and the final increase in temperature.

This test imposes a rather strong (10 kHz) 
RF field for a period of time often used 
in TOCSY experiments, using a recycle time of 
1.5 seconds(including acquisition).  

Single transients are acquired, at a rate of one 
per 1.5 seconds. The data show the temperature 
change with the expected 0.01 ppm/degree. The axis 
is scaled by this factor such that it may be read 
in degrees change relative to initial temperature. 
The intensity and/or linewidths may be used to 
measure temperature homogeneity. The number of 
traces needed to attain a new equilibrium 
temperature measures the ability of the probe to 
stabilize the effects of internal sample heating. 
The final shift value indicates the total temperature 
change. This can be used to reduce the requested 
temperature value so as to obtained the desired 
equilibrium. Of course, the amount of heating is a 
function of the sample itself, primarily its 
salt content.
