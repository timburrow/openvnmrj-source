Phase Switch Settling Time

This test excercises the phase-shift hardware 
by finding the time needed to perform a 180-
degree phase shift. The pulse sequence is a
version of "jump-and-return" in which two
one microsecond pulses are executed just 20
microseconds apart. Ideally, since the second
pulse has a 180-degree phase shift with 
respect to the first pulse, there should be
no excitation. By varying the time before the
second pulse at which the phase shift is
done, an estimate of the phase switch and
settling time can be made.

This time is varied from zero to 20 usecs. The
last spectrum is that from just a single one
microsecond pulse, and serves as a reference.

With proper phase-shift hardware, phase-         
shifting should be accomplished in a little
over 100 nanoseconds.
