Cancellation Test

This tests the reproducibility of the rf for cancellation 
experiments. This simple test compares the signal from a
single pulse (4 single transients) with 10 two-transient
The phase of the pulse is held constant and the receiver
is cycled 0,180, resulting in signal cancellation for nt=2.

The x10 vertical expansion permits measurement 
of the residual signals.
