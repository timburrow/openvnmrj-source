***********************  AUTOTEST  ************** 
         13C Pulse Power and Decoupling Power are User-Defined


13C Probe and Decoupling Tests:

Determine power level for ~10usec pwX
Determine pwX at this power level and 12dB lower
Determine amplifier compression
Determine 13C rfhomogeneity
   (vary 13C pulse in ..90(1H)..1/2JCH..pwX. Determine 360/0, 720/0)
Measure effect of 13C,15N and 13C+15N decoupling on Noise in FID at max powers
Measure effect of 13C,15N and 13C+15N decoupling on Noise in FID as f(power)
Measure decoupling stability at High and Low B2 RF fields
Measure effect of 13C,15N and 13C+15N decoupling on H2O SN and linewidth;
Measure effect of 13C,15N and 13C+15N decoupling on H2O Amplitude Stability;
