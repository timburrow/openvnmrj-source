C13 Adiabatic Decoupling Profiles (Power Limited)

This test shows the effectiveness of adiabatic
phase- and amplitude-modulation schemes for
improbed heteronuclear decoupling. 13C offsets
range over 160 ppm. Waveforms are automatically
created by Pbox from AutoTest 13C calibrations.
 
WURST2 and WURST40 decoupling uses adiabatic
shaped pulses and uses a waveform generator
(See E.Kupce and R.Freeman, Chem.Phys.Letters,
  250, 523(1996)

WURST2 has a higher peak and average power for 
slightly less bandwidth, but lower "cycling  
sidebands". It is useful if these sidebands are 
interfering with small peaks.

WURST40 uses about half the power of WURST2
but will produce cycling sidebands of greater 
intensity. It is most useful in probes where
power must be limited, or in low s/n spectra
where sidebands do not interfere.
