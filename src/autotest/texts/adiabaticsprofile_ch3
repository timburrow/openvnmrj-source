C13 Adiabatic Decoupling Profiles
    Using Channel 3

This test shows the effectiveness of 
sophisticated phase- and amplitude-
modulation schemes for improved
heteronuclear decoupling. 13C offsets
range over 160 ppm. Waveforms are
automatically created by Pbox from
Autotest calibration of 13C.
 

The WURST2 decoupling uses adiabatic
shaped pulses and uses a waveform generator
with an average RF field strength of 1.7 kHz.

The STUD decoupling uses hyperbolic (sech/tanh)
shaped pulses and uses a waveform generator
with an average RF field strength of 1.7 kHz.
