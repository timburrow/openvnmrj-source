RF Excitation Predictability- 

     Rectangular, Gaussian and EBURP-1

At a constant peak power (set by the RF attenuator) 
the 90-degree pulse lengths should reflect their 
theoretical ratios. Here, the pulse lengths are 
in ratios corresponding to theory.

The resulting NMR responses should be 
identical in amplitude.

For this test, the gaussian pulse is either 
controlled by a waveform generator(if present)
or by dirct pulse sequence control.
