Phase Stability

Phase stability is essential for high performance in 
modern experiments. Poor phase stability would produce
poorer water suppression and increase "t1 noise" 
in 2D NMR.

The most robust tests of phase stability are solids "tuneup"
sequences used for verifying performance for line-narrowing 
sequences such as WAHUHA or MREV-8, since these are
fairly independent of amplitude stability.

Another test is the "13-degree" test in which two 90 degree
pulses separated by 1msec are applied with the transmitter 
placed 37 Hz off-resonance. The resulting NMR response 
stability is a product of both RF amplitude stability 
and phase stability since variations in phase between the 
pulses will induce an amplitude change. The observed 
amplitude error should be divided by a factor of 7.1 to 
obtain a measure of phase error (in degrees).
