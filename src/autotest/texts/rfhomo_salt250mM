RF Homogeneity Test: 1H (250mM NaCl Sample)
	
This tests the homogeneity of the RF field strength
throughout the active region of the sample. In an ideal
case, for nuclei having reasonable T2's, the signal 
generated following a 450 degree pulse should match 
that following a 90 degree pulse. The signal strength 
as a function of flip angle should be sinusoidal. 
The amount of dropoff is related to the inhomogeneity
of the RF field.

High RF homogeneity is important since many important 
pulse sequences us a large number of pulses. The signal 
losses accumulate with each pulse such that in 
worst cases all the desired signal is lost.
