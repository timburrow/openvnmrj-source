H2 1kHz Spinlock Stability using Lock Circuit

This tests measures the spinlock reproducibility when
using channel 1 as a transmitter. However, the rf
is routed to the lock circuit in the probe (tn=lk)
instead of the Broadband preamp. The signal is
detected in a normal manner via the lock preamp and
observe mixer/receiver.

The 2H spinlock field is adjusted to produce a
1 kHz RF field.

The statistical analysis produces an rms deviation 
(in percent of the average peak height).
