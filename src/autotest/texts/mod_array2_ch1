RF Power Control using the Linear Modulator
   (Channel 1)

The combination of  Linear Modulator and rf
attenuator gives a 139 dB range of rf power
control. In this case the rf attenuator has
been set at full (-16 dB) attenuation. The
Linear Modulator is then run over its full
72 dB range. The first spectrum results 
from a pulse which is attenuated by 139dB.
This is sufficient attenuation to take a
full power 10usec 90 degree pulse to a
35 second 90 degree pulse.

The linear nature of the data shows that
precise power control is possible with
phase fidelity to the lowest power
controllable, with one linear amplifier.
