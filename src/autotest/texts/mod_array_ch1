RF Power Control using the Linear Modulator

In addition the power control possible with the
(logaritmic) 79 dB range rf attenuator, further
power control is possible using the Linear 
Modulator present on each NMR transmitter board. This 
test shows the output of a series of experiments in 
which the pulse power was changed over the full range 
(72 dB) of the modulator. The linear nature is tested 
by a linear least-squares fit of the data.

Predictable power control is essential for delivering 
accurate shaped pulses, and for precise power level 
control in Hartmann-Hahn experiments in both 
solids and liquids.

The combination of  Linear Modulator and rf
attenuator gives a 139 dB range of rf power
control.
