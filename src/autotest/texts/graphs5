AUTOTEST INSTRUMENT PERFORMANCE HISTORICAL RECORD DISPLAYS
**********************************************************


These are regression analyses of instrument performance tracked
over time. As AutoTest runs are completed the results reported 
in the final single-page report are also archived into separate
directories (HISTORY files). If the graphs option is selected
when AutoTest begins, these data will be plotted in this format 
to provide a convenient check for stability and natural spread of
instrument performance values.

The pexpl program is used to create the plots. At this time
both expl and pexpl do not display or plot data in which all
"Y" points are of equal value. Therefore, in order to view the
data and to carry out the automated plotting, any data sets having
all equal "Y" values must be modified so that the first data 
points are slightly different. This may be necessary to do when
starting out using AutoTest for the first time on a spectrometer.
