Power Control Using RF Attenuator

Overall power control is accomplished using PIN 
diode-controlled RF attenuators.These are precision 
devices that should have negligible phase change 
throughout their full range. The amplitude 
response should also be logarithmic.

The log regression analysis shows the extent of fit 
to the ideal. The stacked phased data show the phase 
behavior. The inset data show the degree to which 
the highest power spectrum is out of phase. 
Each spectral plot has a small incremented phase,
where the base phase is that needed to phase a lower power 
spectrum.

These data do not permit an assessment of the 
cause of the phase error, since the amplifier is
in compression at the maximum power output. The next test 
permits this assessment.
