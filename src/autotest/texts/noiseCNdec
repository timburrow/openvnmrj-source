Noise Test- in Presence of 13C/15N Decoupling

RF purity can be tested by recording data 
without any excitation pulse. In this case,
15N and 13C decoupling are applied at the maximum
user-supplied limit less 6dB. The noise characteristics
of the FID are measured and the "loss" of
S/N is measured by comparing with the same
experiment done with no decouping.
