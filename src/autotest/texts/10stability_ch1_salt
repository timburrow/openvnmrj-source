10 Degree Pulse Stability (Salty Sample)

Modern experiments require very high pulse 
reporducibility to minimize cancellation residuals 
and 't1 noise' in 2D experiments. This tests this 
reproducibility by comparing a series of spectra 
obtained in the same manner: the signal following
a single 10 degree pulse.

The statistical analysis produces an rms deviation 
(in percent of the average peak height). Variations
in phasing are eliminated by using the magnitude mode 
of display. 

Signal-to-noise ratios are averaged and stored. Gain
is increased relative to the same measurements made
with a 90-degree pulse (to permit use of high-Q probes
with higher sensitivity without reducing gain).
