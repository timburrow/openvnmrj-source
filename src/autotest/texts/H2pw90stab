H2 90 Degree Pulse Stability using Lock Circuit

This tests measures the pulse reproducibility when
using channel 1 as a transmitter. However, the rf
is routed to the lock circuit in the probe (tn=lk)
instead of the Broadband preamp. The signal is
detected in a normal manner via the lock preamp and
observe mixer/receiver.

A stable lock is essential to produce a stable
magnetic field and minimizes "t1" noise or 
cancellation artifacts in phase cycling or
difference spectroscopy.

The statistical analysis produces an rms deviation 
(in percent of the average peak height).
