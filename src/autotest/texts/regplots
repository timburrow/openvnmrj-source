AUTOTEST HISTORY RECORD DISPLAYS
********************************


These are regression analyses of 
instrument performance tracked
over time. As AutoTest runs are
completed the results reported 
in the final single-page report
are also archived into separate
directories (history files). If
the graphs option is selected
when AutoTest begins, these data
will be plotted in this format 
to provide a convenient check
for stability and natural spread 
of instrument performance values.
