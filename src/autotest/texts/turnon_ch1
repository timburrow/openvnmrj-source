Pulse Turnon Test 

The quality of modern RF is good enough that 
examination of pulse shapes using an oscilloscope 
is not as informative as well-designed and 
executed NMR tests. The turnon and turnoff 
characteristics of a very short pulse are properties 
that can be measured sensitively by NMR.

The Turnon Test measures the amplitude of a signal 
following a short pulse which is arrayed. 
In the limit of small flip angle this dependence is 
linear. The data is analyzed and least-squares fit 
to a straight line. The intercept is the 
pulse turnon time.
